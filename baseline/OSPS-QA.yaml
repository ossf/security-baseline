  criterion: |
    The project's source code MUST be publicly
    readable and have a static URL.
  rationale: |
    Enable users to access and review the
    project's source code and history, promoting
    transparency and collaboration within the
    project community.
  details: |
    Use a common VCS such as GitHub, GitLab, or
    Bitbucket. Ensure the repository is publicly
    readable. Avoid duplication or mirroring of
    repositories unless highly visible
    documentation clarifies the primary source.
    Avoid frequent changes to the repository
    that would impact the repository URL.

  maturity_level: 1
  category: Quality
  criterion: |
    The version control system MUST contain a
    publicly readable record of all changes
    made, who made the changes, and when the
    changes were made.
  rationale: |
    Provide transparency and accountability for
    changes made to the project's codebase,
    enabling users to track modifications and
    understand the history of the project.
  details: |
    Use a common VCS such as GitHub, GitLab, or
    Bitbucket to maintain a publicly readable
    commit history. Avoid squashing or rewriting
    commits in a way that would obscure the
    author of any commits.

  category: Quality
  criterion: |
    All released software assets MUST be
    delivered with a machine-readable list of
    all direct and transitive internal software
    dependencies with their associated version
    identifiers.
  rationale: |
    Provide transparency and accountability for
    the project's dependencies, enabling users
    and contributors to understand the
    software's dependencies and versions.
  details: |
    This may take the form of a software bill of
    materials (SBOM) or a dependency file that
    lists all direct and transitive dependencies
    such as package.json, Gemfile.lock, or
    go.sum.

    It is recommended to use a CycloneDX or SPDX
    file that is auto-generated at build time by
    a tool that has been vetted for accuracy.
    This enables users to ingest this data in a
    standardized approach alongside other
    projects in their environment.

  category: Quality
  criterion: |
    Any automated status checks for commits MUST
    pass or require manual acknowledgement prior to
    merge.
  rationale: |
    Ensure that the project's approvers do not
    become accustomed to tolerating failing
    status checks, even if arbitrary, because it
    increases the risk of overlooking security
    vulnerabilities or defects identified by
    automated checks.
  details: |
    Configure the project's version control
    system to require that all automated status
    checks pass or require manual acknowledgement
    before a commit can be merged into the
    primary branch.

    It is recommended that any optional
    status checks are NOT configured as a pass
    or fail requirement that approvers may be
    tempted to bypass.

  category: Quality
  criterion: |
    Any additional subproject code repositories
    produced by the project and compiled into a
    release MUST enforce security requirements as
    applicable to the status and intent of the
    respective codebase.
  rationale: |
    Ensure that additional code repositories or
    subprojects produced by the project are held
    to a standard that clear and appropriate
    for that codebase.
  details: |
    The parent project should maintain a list of
    any codebases that are considered
    subprojects or additional repositories.
    Collaborators on those repositories should
    identify the proper maturity level and apply
    the Open Source Project Security Baseline to
    the codebase. Any subproject or repository
    from the project which is compiled into the
    primary project must be held to the same 
    standard as the primary project. Others may
    be held to a lower standard if they have
    lower levels of adoption or are not intended
    for general use.

  criterion: |
    The version control system MUST NOT contain
    generated executable artifacts.
  rationale: |
    Reduce the risk of including generated
    executable artifacts in the project's
    version control system, ensuring that only
    source code and necessary files are stored
    in the repository.
  details: |
    Remove generated executable artifacts
    in the project's version control system.

    It is recommended that any scenario where a
    generated executable artifact appears
    critical to a process such as testing, it
    should be instead be generated at build time
    or stored separately and fetched during a
    specific well-documented pipeline step.

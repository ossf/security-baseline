category: Quality
description: |
  Quality criteria focus on the processes and
  practices used to ensure the quality and
  reliability of the project's source code and
  software assets. These criteria help ensure
  that the project's source code is well
  maintained, secure, and reliable, reducing the
  risk of defects or vulnerabilities in the
  software.
criteria:
  - id: OSPS-QA-01
    maturity_level: 1
    criterion: |
      The project's source code MUST be publicly
      readable and have a static URL.
    rationale: |
      Enable users to access and review the
      project's source code and history, promoting
      transparency and collaboration within the
      project community.
    details: |
      Use a common VCS such as GitHub, GitLab, or
      Bitbucket. Ensure the repository is publicly
      readable. Avoid duplication or mirroring of
      repositories unless highly visible
      documentation clarifies the primary source.
      Avoid frequent changes to the repository
      that would impact the repository URL.

  - id: OSPS-QA-02
    maturity_level: 1
    criterion: |
      The version control system MUST contain a
      publicly readable record of all changes
      made, who made the changes, and when the
      changes were made.
    rationale: |
      Provide transparency and accountability for
      changes made to the project's codebase,
      enabling users to track modifications and
      understand the history of the project.
    details: |
      Use a common VCS such as GitHub, GitLab, or
      Bitbucket to maintain a publicly readable
      commit history. Avoid squashing or rewriting
      commits in a way that would obscure the
      author of any commits.

  - id: OSPS-QA-03
    maturity_level: 1
    criterion: |
      The code repository MUST contain a dependency 
      list that accounts for the direct language dependencies
      when the package management system supports it.
    rationale: |
      Provide transparency and accountability for
      the project's dependencies
      while enabling users and contributors to understand the
      software's direct dependencies.
    details: |
      This may take the form a package manager or
      language dependency file that ennumerates all
      direct dependencies such as package.json, 
      Gemfile, or go.mod.

  - id: OSPS-QA-04
    maturity_level: 2
    criterion: |
      Any automated status checks for commits MUST
      pass or require manual acknowledgement prior to
      merge.
    rationale: |
      Ensure that the project's approvers do not
      become accustomed to tolerating failing
      status checks, even if arbitrary, because it
      increases the risk of overlooking security
      vulnerabilities or defects identified by
      automated checks.
    details: |
      Configure the project's version control
      system to require that all automated status
      checks pass or require manual acknowledgement
      before a commit can be merged into the
      primary branch.

      It is recommended that any optional
      status checks are NOT configured as a pass
      or fail requirement that approvers may be
      tempted to bypass.

  - id: OSPS-QA-05
    maturity_level: 3
    criterion: |
      Any additional subproject code repositories
      produced by the project and compiled into a
      release MUST enforce security requirements as
      applicable to the status and intent of the
      respective codebase.
    rationale: |
      Ensure that additional code repositories or
      subprojects produced by the project are held
      to a standard that clear and appropriate
      for that codebase.
    details: |
      The parent project should maintain a list of
      any codebases that are considered
      subprojects or additional repositories.
      Collaborators on those repositories should
      identify the proper maturity level and apply
      the Open Source Project Security Baseline to
      the codebase. Any subproject or repository
      from the project which is compiled into the
      primary project must be held to the same 
      standard as the primary project. Others may
      be held to a lower standard if they have
      lower levels of adoption or are not intended
      for general use.

  - id: OSPS-QA-06
    maturity_level: 2
    criterion: |
      The version control system MUST NOT contain
      generated executable artifacts.
    rationale: |
      Reduce the risk of including generated
      executable artifacts in the project's
      version control system, ensuring that only
      source code and necessary files are stored
      in the repository.
    details: |
      Remove generated executable artifacts
      in the project's version control system.

      It is recommended that any scenario where a
      generated executable artifact appears
      critical to a process such as testing, it
      should be instead be generated at build time
      or stored separately and fetched during a
      specific well-documented pipeline step.

    criterion: |
      The project MUST use at least one automated
      test suite for the source code repository
      which clearly documents when and how tests
      are run.

      add or update tests of the functionality
      in an automated test suite.

    criterion: |
      The project's version control system MUST
      require at least one non-author approval of
      changes before merging into the release or
      primary branch.

    criterion: |
      All compiled released software assets MUST be
      delivered with a software bill of materials.
    rationale: |
      Provide transparency and accountability for
      the project's dependencies in a standard format,
      allowing automated systems to understand the
      software's dependencies and versions.
    details: |
      It is recommended to auto-generate SBOMs at build time
      using a tool that has been vetted for accuracy.
      This enables users to ingest this data in a
      standardized approach alongside other
      projects in their environment.

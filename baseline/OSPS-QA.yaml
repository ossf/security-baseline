  Quality focuses on the processes and
  practices used to ensure the quality and
  reliability of the project's source code and
  software assets. These controls help ensure
  that the project's source code is well
  maintained, secure, and reliable, reducing the
  risk of defects or vulnerabilities in the
  software.

          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Use a common VCS such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Ensure the
          repository is publicly readable. Avoid duplication or mirroring of
          repositories unless highly visible documentation clarifies the primary
          source. Avoid frequent changes to the repository that would impact the
          repository URL.

        recommendation: |
          Use a common VCS such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to maintain a

          The source code repository MUST contain a dependency list that
          accounts for the direct language dependencies when the package
          management system supports it.

          - Maturity Level 1

          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          This may take the form a package manager or language dependency file
          that enumerates all direct dependencies such as package.json, Gemfile,
          or go.mod.

        recommendation: |
          It is recommended to auto-generate SBOMs at build time using a tool
          that has been vetted for accuracy. This enables users to ingest this
          data in a standardized approach alongside other projects in their
          environment.

      Automated status checks for commits don't fail prior to merge
    objective: |
      Ensure that the project's approvers do not become accustomed to tolerating
      failing status checks, even if arbitrary, because it increases the risk of
      overlooking security vulnerabilities or defects identified by automated
      checks.

          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Configure the project's version control system to require that all
          automated status checks pass or require manual acknowledgement before a
          commit can be merged into the primary branch. It is recommended that
          any optional status checks are NOT configured as a pass or fail
          requirement that approvers may be tempted to bypass.

      Enforce matching requirements for subproject code repositories
    objective: |
      Ensure that additional code repositories or subprojects produced by the
      project are held to a standard that is clear and appropriate for that
      codebase.

          Any additional subproject code repositories produced by the project
          and compiled into a release MUST enforce security requirements as
          applicable to the status and intent of the respective codebase.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          The parent project should maintain a list of any codebases that are
          considered subprojects or additional repositories. Collaborators on
          those repositories should identify the proper maturity level and apply
          the Open Source Project Security Baseline to the codebase. Any
          subproject or repository from the project which is compiled into the
          primary project must be held to the same standard as the primary
          project. Others may be held to a lower standard if they have lower
          levels of adoption or are not intended for general use.

      Remove generated executable artifacts from the version control system
    objective: |
      Reduce the risk of including generated executable artifacts in the

        recommendation: |
          Remove generated executable artifacts in the project's version control
          system. It is recommended that any scenario where a generated
          executable artifact appears critical to a process such as testing, it
          should be instead be generated at build time or stored separately and
          fetched during a specific well-documented pipeline step.

        recommendation: | # give examples
          Automated tests should be run prior to every merge into the primary
          branch. The test suite should be run in a CI/CD pipeline and the
          results should be visible to all contributors. The test suite should
          be run in a consistent environment and should be run in a way that
          allows contributors to run the tests locally.
          Examples of test suites include unit tests, integration tests, and
          end-to-end tests.

        recommendation: |
          Add a section to the contributing documentation that explains how to
          run the tests locally and how to run the tests in the CI/CD pipeline.
          The documentation should explain what the tests are testing and how to
          interpret the results.

          The project's documentation MUST include a policy that all major

          tests of the functionality in an automated test suite.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Add a section to the contributing documentation that explains the
          policy for adding or updating tests. The policy should explain what
          constitutes a major change and what tests should be added or updated.

          reviewed and approved by at least one other contributor before it can
          be merged.

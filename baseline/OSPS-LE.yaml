description: |
  Legal criteria focus on the policies and
  procedures that govern the project's licensing
  and intellectual property. These criteria help
  ensure that the project's source code is
  distributed under a recognized and legally
  enforceable open source software license,
  reducing the risk of intellectual property
  disputes or licensing violations.
criteria:
  - id: OSPS-LE-01
    maturity_level: 2
    criterion: |
      The version control system MUST require all
      code contributors to assert that they are
      legally authorized to commit the associated
      contributions on every commit.
    rationale: |
      Ensure that code contributors are aware of
      and acknowledge their legal responsibility
      for the contributions they make to the
      project, reducing the risk of intellectual
      property disputes against the project.
    details: |
      Include a DCO or CLA in the project's
      repository, requiring code contributors to
      assert that they are legally authorized to
      commit the associated contributions on every
      commit. Use a status check to ensure the
      assertion is made.

  - id: OSPS-LE-02
    maturity_level: 1
    criterion: |
      The license for the source code MUST
      meet the OSI Open Source Definition or
      the FSF Free Software Definition.
    rationale: |
      Ensure that the project's source code is
      distributed under a recognized and legally
      enforceable open source software license,
      providing clarity on how the code
      can be used and shared by others.
    details: |
      Add a LICENSE file to the project's repo
      with a license that is
      an approved license by the
      Open Source Initiative (OSI), or
      a free license as approved by the
      Free Software Foundation (FSF).
      Examples of such licenses include the
      MIT, BSD 2-clause, BSD 3-clause revised,
      Apache 2.0, Lesser GNU General Public
      License (LGPL), and the
      GNU General Public License (GPL).
      Releasing to the public domain (e.g., CC0)
      meets this criterion if there are no
      other encumbrances (e.g., patents).

  - id: OSPS-LE-03
    maturity_level: 1
    criterion: |
      The license for the source code MUST be
      maintained in a standard location within
      the project's repository.
    rationale: |
      Ensure that the project's source code is
      distributed with the appropriate license
      terms, making it clear to users and
      contributors how the code can be used and
      shared.
    details: |
      Include the project's source code license in
      the project's LICENSE file, COPYING file,
      or LICENSE/
      directory to provide visibility and clarity
      on the licensing terms. The filename MAY
      have an extension.

  - id: OSPS-LE-04
    maturity_level: 1
    criterion: |
      The license for the released software assets
      MUST meet the OSI Open Source Definition or
      the FSF Free Software Definition.
    rationale: |
      Ensure that the project's source code is
      distributed under a recognized and legally
      enforceable open source software license,
      providing clarity on how the code
      can be used and shared by others.
    details: |
      If a different license is included with
      released software assets, ensure it is
      an approved license by the
      Open Source Initiative (OSI), or
      a free license as approved by the
      Free Software Foundation (FSF).
      Examples of such licenses include the
      MIT, BSD 2-clause, BSD 3-clause revised,
      Apache 2.0, Lesser GNU General Public
      License (LGPL), and the
      GNU General Public License (GPL).
      Note that the license for the released
      software assets may be different than the
      source code.

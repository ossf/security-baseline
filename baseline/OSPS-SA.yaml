category: Security Assessment
description: |
  Security Assessment criteria encourage practices that
  help ensure that the project is well positioned
  to identify and address security vulnerabilities
  and threats in the software.
criteria:
  - id: OSPS-SA-01
    maturity_level: 2
    criterion: |
      The project documentation MUST provide
      design documentation demonstrating all
      actions and actors within the system.
    rationale: |
      Provide an overview of the project's design
      and architecture, illustrating the
      interactions and components of the system to
      help contributors and security reviewers
      understand the internal logic of the
      released software assets.
    details: |
      Include designs in the project documentation
      that explains the actions and actors. Actors
      include any subsystem or entity that can
      influence another segment in the system.

  - id: OSPS-SA-02
    maturity_level: 1
    criterion: |
      The project documentation MUST include
      descriptions of all external input and output
      interfaces of the released software assets.
    rationale: |
      Provide users and developers with an
      understanding of how to interact with the
      project's software and integrate it with
      other systems, enabling them to use the
      software effectively.
    details: |
      Document all input and output interfaces of
      the released software assets, explaining how
      users can interact with the software and
      what data is expected or produced.

  - id: OSPS-SA-03
    maturity_level: 3
    criterion: |
      The project MUST perform a threat modeling and
      attack surface analysis to understand and
      protect against attacks on critical code
      paths, functions, and interactions within
      the system.
    rationale: |
      Providing project maintainers an understand of how
      the software can be misused or broken allows them
      to paln mitigations to close off the potential of 
      those threats from occuring.

      Providing downstream consumers with this threat model
      can assist them in understanding the security capabilities
      or gaps that exist within the project and allows them 
      to apply their own additional controls and mitigations.
    implementation: |
      Threat modeling is an activity where the project
      looks at the codebase, associated processes and 
      infrastructure, interfaces, key components and 
      "thinks like a hacker" and brainstorms how the 
      system be be broken or compromised.

      Each identified threat is listed out so the project
      can then think about how to proactively avoid or 
      close off any gaps/vulnerabilities that could arise.

      Threat modeling can be something as simple as using the
      [Shostack "4 Questions" model](https://github.com/adamshostack/4QuestionFrame), 
      using a methodology like [STRIDE](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process), 
      a tool like the [Elevation of Privilege Threat Modeling Card Game](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20303}
      or tools such as [Threat Dragon](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/)

  - id: OSPS-SA-04
    maturity_level: 2
    criterion: |
        The project MUST perform a security
        assessment to understand the most likely and
        impactful potential security problems that
        could occur within the software.
    rationale: |
      Performing a security assessment informs both project 
      members as well as downstream consumers that the 
      project understands what problems could arise within
      the software.

      Understanding what threats could be realized helps
      the project manage and address risk.  This information
      is useful to downstream consumers to demonstrate
      the security accumen and practices of the project.
    implementation: |
      Security assessments can take many forms in a spectrum
      ranging from informal to highly rigourous.  At its most 
      basic, a security assessment lists potential threats, 
      estimates the likelihood/probability of those threats
      occuring and the the possible consquences/impact if those
      threats do occur.

      Software that is deployed into highly-regulated spaces
      would benefit from more formal risk management practices
      such as [NIST SP 800-171](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf), 
      [ENISA's Risk Management Framework](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/risk-management), 
      or a methodolgy such as [OpenFAIR](https://www.opengroup.org/open-fair).

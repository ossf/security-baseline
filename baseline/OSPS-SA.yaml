category: Security Assessment
description: |
  Security Assessment criteria encourage practices that
  help ensure that the project is well positioned
  to identify and address security vulnerabilities
  and threats in the software.
criteria:
  - id: OSPS-SA-201
    maturity_level: 2
    criterion: |
      The project documentation MUST provide
      design documentation demonstrating all
      actions and actors within the system.
    rationale: |
      Provide an overview of the project's design
      and architecture, illustrating the
      interactions and components of the system to
      help contributors and security reviewers
      understand the internal logic of the
      released software assets.
    details: |
      Include designs in the project documentation
      that explains the actions and actors. Actors
      include any subsystem or entity that can
      influence another segment in the system.

  - id: OSPS-SA-202
    maturity_level: 2
    criterion: |
      The project documentation MUST include
      descriptions of all external input and output
      interfaces of the released software assets.
    rationale: |
      Provide users and developers with an
      understanding of how to interact with the
      project's software and integrate it with
      other systems, enabling them to use the
      software effectively.
    details: |
      Document all input and output interfaces of
      the released software assets, explaining how
      users can interact with the software and
      what data is expected or produced.

    maturity_level: 3
    criterion: |
      The project MUST perform a threat modeling and
      attack surface analysis to understand and
      protect against attacks on critical code
      paths, functions, and interactions within
      the system.

    criterion: |
        The project MUST perform a security
        assessment to understand the most likely and
        impactful potential security problems that
        could occur within the software.

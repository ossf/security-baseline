      The project documentation MUST include the roles and responsibilities
      for members of the project.
    objective: |
      Documenting project roles and responsibilities helps project participants,
      potential contributors, and downstream consumers have an accurate
      understanding of who is working on the project and what areas of authority
      they may have.

          This may be as simple as including names or account handles in a list
          of maintainers, or more complex depending on the project's governance.

        recommendation: |
          Publish an enforceable policy in the project documentation that
          requires code contributors to be reviewed and approved before being
          granted escalated permissions to sensitive resources, such as merge
          approval or access to secrets. It is recommended that vetting includes
          establishing a justifiable lineage of identity such as confirming the
          contributor's association with a known trusted organization.

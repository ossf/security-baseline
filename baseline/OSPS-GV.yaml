description: |
  Governance criteria focus on the policies and
  procedures that guide the project's decision-making
  and community interactions. These criteria help ensure
  that the project is well positioned to respond to
  both threats and opportunities.
criteria:
  - id: OSPS-GV-01
    maturity_level: 2
    criterion: |
      The project documentation MUST include the
      Roles and Responsibilities for members of the
      project.
    rationale: # TODO
    implementation: # TODO
    control_mappings: # TODO
    security_insights_value: # TODO

  - id: OSPS-GV-02
    maturity_level: 1
    criterion: |
      The project MUST have one or more mechanisms
      for public discussions about proposed
      changes and usage obstacles.
    rationale: |
      Encourages open communication and
      collaboration within the project community,
      enabling users to provide feedback and
      discuss proposed changes or usage
      challenges.
    details: |
      Establish one or more mechanisms for public 
      discussions within the project, such as
      mailing lists, instant messaging, or issue
      trackers, to facilitate open communication
      and feedback.

  - id: OSPS-GV-03
    maturity_level: 1
    criterion: |
      The project documentation MUST include an
      explanation of the contribution process.
    rationale: |
      Provide guidance to new contributors on how
      to participate in the project, outlining the
      steps required to submit changes or
      enhancements to the project's codebase.
    details: |
      Create a CONTRIBUTING.md or CONTRIBUTING/
      directory to outline the contribution
      process including the steps for submitting
      changes, and engaging with the project
      maintainers.
    control_mappings: # TODO
    security_insights_value: # TODO

  - id: OSPS-GV-04
    maturity_level: 2
    criterion: |
      The project documentation MUST include a
      guide for code contributors that includes
      requirements for acceptable contributions.
    rationale: |
      Provide guidance to code contributors on how
      to submit changes and enhancements to the
      project's codebase, outlining the standards
      and expectations for acceptable
      contributions.
    details: |
      Extend the CONTRIBUTING.md or CONTRIBUTING/
      contents in the project documentation to
      outline the requirements for acceptable
      contributions, including coding standards,
      testing requirements, and submission
      guidelines for code contributors.

      It is recommended that this guide is the
      source of truth for both contributors and
      approvers.

  - id: OSPS-GV-05
    maturity_level: 2
    criterion: |
      The project documentation MUST have a policy
      that code contributors are reviewed prior to
      granting escalated permissions to sensitive
      resources.
    rationale: |
      Ensure that code contributors are vetted and
      reviewed before being granted elevated
      permissions to sensitive resources within
      the project, reducing the risk of
      unauthorized access or misuse.
    details: |
      Publish an enforceable policy in the project
      documentation that requires code
      contributors to be reviewed and approved
      before being granted escalated permissions
      to sensitive resources, such as merge
      approval or access to secrets.

      It is recommended that vetting includes
      establishing a justifiable lineage of
      identity such as confirming the
      contributor's association with a known
      trusted organization.

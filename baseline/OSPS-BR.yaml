category: Build and Release
description: |
  Build and Release criteria focus on the processes and
  tools used to compile, package, and distribute the
  project's software. These criteria help ensure that the
  project's build and release pipelines are secure,
  consistent, and reliable, reducing the risk of
  vulnerabilities or errors in the software distribution
  process.
criteria:
  - id: OSPS-BR-01
    maturity_level: 1
    criterion: |
      The project's build and release pipelines
      MUST NOT permit untrusted input that allows
      access to privileged resources.
    rationale: |
      Reduce the risk of code injection or other
      security vulnerabilities in the project's
      build and release by preventing untrusted input
      to access privileged resources
      (secret exfiltration, final release, etc.)
    details: |
      Ensure that any integration or release pipeline actions
      that accept externally-controlled untrusted input (e.g. git
      branch names) do not use input in ways that could
      provide unintended access to privileged resources.

  - id: OSPS-BR-02
    maturity_level: 2
    criterion: |
      All releases and released software assets
      MUST be assigned a unique version
      identifier for each release intended to be
      used by users.
    rationale: |
      Ensure that each software asset produced by
      the  project is uniquely identified,
      enabling users to track changes and updates
      to the project over time.
    details: |
      Assign a unique version identifier to each
      release and associated software asset
      produced by the project, following a
      consistent naming convention or numbering
      scheme.
      Examples include SemVer, CalVer, or
      git commit id.

  - id: OSPS-BR-03
    maturity_level: 1
    criterion: |
      Any websites and version control systems
      involved in the project development
      MUST be delivered using SSH,
      HTTPS, or other encrypted channels.
    rationale: |
      Protect the confidentiality and integrity
      of project source code during development,
      reducing the risk of eavesdropping or data
      tampering.
    details: |
      Configure the project's websites and version
      control systems to use encrypted channels
      such as SSH or HTTPS for data transmission.

  - id: OSPS-BR-04
    maturity_level: 2
    criterion: |
      All released software assets MUST be created
      with consistent, automated build and release
      pipelines.
    rationale: |
      Ensure that the project's software assets
      are built and released using consistent and
      automated processes, reducing the risk of
      errors or inconsistencies in the deployment
      and distribution of the software.
    details: |
      VCS-integrated pipelines are
      recommended to ensure consistency and
      automation in the build and release
      processes.

  - id: OSPS-BR-05
    maturity_level: 2
    criterion: |
      All build and release pipelines MUST use
      standardized tooling where available to
      ingest dependencies at build time.
    rationale: |
      Ensure that the project's build and release
      pipelines use standardized tools and
      processes to manage dependencies, reducing
      the risk of compatibility issues or security
      vulnerabilities in the software.
    details: |
      Use a common tooling for your ecosystem,
      such as package managers or dependency
      management tools to ingest dependencies at
      build time. This may include using a
      dependency file, lock file, or manifest to
      specify the required dependencies, which are
      then pulled in by the build system.

  - id: OSPS-BR-06
    maturity_level: 2
    criterion: |
      All releases MUST provide a descriptive log
      of functional and security modifications.
    rationale: |
      Provide transparency and accountability for
      changes made to the project's software
      releases, enabling users to understand the
      modifications and improvements included in
      each release.
    details: |
      Ensure that all releases include a
      descriptive change log. 

      It is recommended to ensure that the change
      log is human-readable and includes details
      beyond commit messages, such as descriptions 
      of the security impact or relevance to
      different use cases.

  - id: OSPS-BR-08
    maturity_level: 2
    criterion: |
      All released software assets MUST be signed
      or accounted for in a signed manifest
      including each asset's cryptographic hashes.
    rationale: |
      Provide users with a mechanism to verify the
      authenticity and integrity of released 
      software assets, reducing the risk of
      tampering or unauthorized modifications.
    details: |
      Sign all released software assets at build
      time with a cryptographic signature or
      attestations, such  as GPG or PGP signature,
      Sigstore signatures, SLSA provenance, or SLSA
      VSAs. Include the cryptographic hashes of
      each asset in a signed manifest or
      metadata file.

    criterion: |
      Any websites or other services involved in the
      distribution of released software assets MUST
      be delivered using HTTPS or other encrypted
      channels.
    rationale: |
      Protect the confidentiality and integrity
      of release assets consumed by the project's
      users, reducing the risk of eavesdropping or
      data tampering.
    details: |
      Configure the project's websites and
      distribution services to use encrypted channels
      such as HTTPS for data transmission.

    criterion: |
      Any websites, API responses or other
      services involved in release pipelines MUST be
      fetched using SSH, HTTPS or other encrypted
      channels.
    rationale: |
      Protect the confidentiality and integrity
      of assets used in the release pipeline,
      reducing the risk of eavesdropping or data
      tampering.
    details: |
      Configure the project's release pipeline to
      only fetch data from websites, API
      responses, and other services which use
      encrypted channels such as SSH or HTTPS for
      data transmission.

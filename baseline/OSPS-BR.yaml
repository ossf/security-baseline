  Build and Release focuses on the processes and
  tools used to compile, package, and distribute the
  project's software. These controls help ensure that the
  project's build and release pipelines are secure,
  consistent, and reliable, reducing the risk of
  vulnerabilities or errors in the software distribution
  process.

      The project's build and release pipelines MUST NOT permit untrusted
      input that allows access to privileged resources.
    objective: |
      Reduce the risk of code injection or other security vulnerabilities in the
      project's build and release pipelines by preventing untrusted input from
      accessing privileged resources.

          includes details beyond commit messages, such as descriptions of the
          security impact or relevance to different use cases. To ensure
          machine readability, place the content under a markdown header
          such as "## Changelog".

          - Maturity Level 2
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Use a common tooling for your ecosystem, such as package managers or
          dependency management tools to ingest dependencies at build time. This
          may include using a dependency file, lock file, or manifest to specify
          the required dependencies, which are then pulled in by the build
          system.

          Sign all released software assets at build time with a cryptographic
          signature or attestations, such as GPG or PGP signature, Sigstore
          signatures, SLSA provenance, or SLSA VSAs. Include the cryptographic
          hashes of each asset in a signed manifest or metadata file.

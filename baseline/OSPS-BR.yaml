category: Build and Release
description: |
  Build and Release focuses on the processes and
  tools used to compile, package, and distribute the
  project's software. These controls help ensure that the
  project's build and release pipelines are secure,
  consistent, and reliable, reducing the risk of
  vulnerabilities or errors in the software distribution
  process.

      Prevent untrusted input from accessing privileged resources
    objective: |
      Reduce the risk of code injection or other security vulnerabilities in the
      project's build and release pipelines by preventing untrusted input from
      accessing privileged resources.

          The project's build and release pipelines MUST NOT permit untrusted
          input that allows access to privileged resources.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 1
          - Maturity Level 2
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Ensure that any integration or release pipeline actions that accept
          externally-controlled untrusted input do not use that input in ways
          that could provide unintended access to privileged resources.
          An example of a common infraction is improper use of git branch names.

        recommendation: |
          Assign a unique version identifier to each release and associated
          software asset produced by the project, following a consistent naming
          convention or numbering scheme. Examples include SemVer, CalVer, or
          git commit id.

        recommendation: |
          Ensure that all releases include a descriptive change log. It is
          recommended to ensure that the change log is human-readable and
          includes details beyond commit messages, such as descriptions of the
          security impact or relevance to different use cases.

      Use standardized tooling to ingest dependencies at build time
    objective: |
      Ensure that the project's build and release pipelines use standardized tools
      and processes to manage dependencies, reducing the risk of compatibility
      issues or security vulnerabilities in the software.

        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 2
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Use a common tooling for your ecosystem, such as package managers or
          dependency management tools to ingest dependencies at build time. This
          may include using a dependency file, lock file, or manifest to specify
          the required dependencies, which are then pulled in by the build
          system.

          signature or attestations, such as GPG or PGP signature, Sigstore
          signatures, SLSA provenance, or SLSA VSAs. Include the cryptographic
          hashes of each asset in a signed manifest or metadata file.

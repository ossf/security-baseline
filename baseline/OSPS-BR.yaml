title: Build and Release
description: |
  Build and Release focuses on the processes and
  tools used to compile, package, and distribute the
  project's software. These controls help ensure that the
  project's build and release pipelines are secure,
  consistent, and reliable, reducing the risk of
  vulnerabilities or errors in the software distribution
  process.

      The project's build and release pipelines MUST NOT permit untrusted
      input that allows access to privileged resources.
    objective: |
      Reduce the risk of code injection or other security vulnerabilities in the
      project's build and release pipelines by preventing untrusted input from
      accessing privileged resources.

  criterion: |
    The project's build and release pipelines
    MUST NOT execute arbitrary code that is
    input from outside of the build script.
  rationale: |
    Reduce the risk of code injection or other
    security vulnerabilities in the project's
    build and release processes by restricting
    the execution of external code.
  details: |
    Ensure that the project's build and release
    pipelines do not execute arbitrary code
    provided from external sources.

  category: Build & Release
  criterion: |
    All releases and released software assets
    MUST be assigned a unique version
    identifier for each release intended to be
    used by users.
  rationale: |
    Ensure that each software asset produced by
    the  project is uniquely identified,
    enabling users to track changes and updates
    to the project over time.
  details: |
    Assign a unique version identifier to each
    release and associated software asset
    produced by the project, following a
    consistent naming convention or numbering
    scheme.
    Examples include SemVer, CalVer, or
    git commit id.

  criterion: |
    Any websites, API responses or other
    services involved in the project development
    and release MUST be delivered using SSH,
    HTTPS or other encrypted channels.
  rationale: |
    Protect the confidentiality and integrity
    of data transmitted between the project's
    services and users, reducing the risk of
    eavesdropping or data tampering.
  details: |
    Configure the project's websites, API
    responses, and other services to use
    encrypted channels such as SSH or HTTPS for
    data transmission.

  maturity_level: 2
  category: Build & Release
  criterion: |
    All released software assets MUST be created
    with consistent, automated build and release
    pipelines.
  rationale: |
    Ensure that the project's software assets
    are built and released using consistent and
    automated processes, reducing the risk of
    errors or inconsistencies in the deployment
    and distribution of the software.
  details: |
    VCS-integrated pipelines are
    recommended to ensure consistency and
    automation in the build and release
    processes.

  maturity_level: 2
  category: Build & Release
  criterion: |
    All build and release pipelines MUST use
    standardized tooling where available to
    ingest dependencies at build time.
  rationale: |
    Ensure that the project's build and release
    pipelines use standardized tools and
    processes to manage dependencies, reducing
    the risk of compatibility issues or security
    vulnerabilities in the software.
  details: |
    Use a common tooling for your ecosystem,
    such as package managers or dependency
    management tools to ingest dependencies at
    build time. This may include using a
    dependency file, lock file, or manifest to
    specify the required dependencies, which are
    then pulled in by the build system.

  category: Build & Release
  criterion: |
    All releases MUST provide a descriptive log
    of functional and security modifications.
  rationale: |
    Provide transparency and accountability for
    changes made to the project's software
    releases, enabling users to understand the
    modifications and improvements included in
    each release.
  details: |
    Ensure that all releases include a
    descriptive change log. 

    It is recommended to ensure that the change
    log is human-readable and includes details
    beyond commit messages, such as descriptions 
    of the security impact or relevance to
    different use cases.

  maturity_level: 2
  category: Build & Release
  criterion: |
    All released software assets MUST be signed
    or accounted for in a signed manifest
    including each asset's cryptographic hashes.
  rationale: |
    Provide users with a mechanism to verify the
    authenticity and integrity of released 
    software assets, reducing the risk of
    tampering or unauthorized modifications.
  details: |
    Sign all released software assets at build
    time with a cryptographic signature or
    attestations, such  as GPG or PGP signature,
    Sigstore signatures, SLSA provenance, or SLSA
    VSAs. Include the cryptographic hashes of
    each asset in a signed manifest or
    metadata file.

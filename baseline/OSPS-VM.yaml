category: Vulnerability Management
description: |
  Vulnerability Management criteria focus on the
  processes and practices used to identify and
  address security vulnerabilities in the project's
  software dependencies. These criteria help ensure
  that the project is well positioned to respond to
  security threats and vulnerabilities in the software.
criteria:
  - id: OSPS-VM-01
    maturity_level: 3
    criterion: |
      The project documentation MUST include a
      policy that defines a threshold for remediation
      of SCA findings related to vulnerabilities and
      licenses.
    rationale: |
      Ensure that the project clearly communicates
      the threshold for remediation of SCA findings,
      including vulnerabilities and license issues
      in software dependencies.
    details: |
      Document a policy in the project that
      defines a threshold for remediation of SCA
      findings related to vulnerabilities and
      licenses. Include the process for
      identifying, prioritizing, and remediating
      these findings.

  - id: OSPS-VM-02
    maturity_level: 3
    criterion: |
      The project documentation MUST include a
      policy to address SCA violations prior to any
      release.
    rationale: |
      Ensure that violations of your SCA policy
      are addressed before software releases,
      reducing the risk of shipping insecure or
      non-compliant software.
    details: |
      Document a policy in the project to address
      applicable Software Composition Analysis 
      results before any release, and add status
      checks that verify compliance with that 
      policy prior to release.

  - id: OSPS-VM-03
    maturity_level: 2
    criterion: |
      The project documentation MUST include a
      policy for coordinated vulnerability
      reporting, with a clear timeframe for
      response.
    rationale: |
      Establish a process for reporting and
      addressing vulnerabilities in the project,
      ensuring that security issues are handled
      promptly and transparently.
    details: |
      Create a SECURITY.md file at the root of the
      directory, outlining the project's policy
      for coordinated vulnerability reporting.
      Include a method for reporting
      vulnerabilities. Set expectations for the
      how the project will respond and address
      reported issues.

  - id: OSPS-VM-04
    maturity_level: 3
    criterion: |
      All proposed changes to the project's
      codebase must be automatically evaluated 
      against a documented policy for known
      vulnerabilities and blocked in the
      event of violations except when declared
      and supressed as non exploitable.
    rationale: |
      Identify and address defects and security weaknesses 
      in the project's codebase early in the 
      development process, reducing the risk of 
      shipping insecure software.
    details: |
      Create a status check in the project's
      version control system that runs a Static
      Application Security Testing (SAST) tool on
      all changes to the codebase. Require that the
      status check passes before changes can be
      merged.
    control_mappings: # TODO

  - id: OSPS-VM-05
    maturity_level: 1
    criterion: |
      The project publishes contacts and process
      for reporting vulnerabilities.
    rationale: |
       # TODO 
    details: |
       Create a security.md (or similarly-named) file that contains security 
       contacts for the project and provide project's
       process for handling vulnerabilities in the project or dependencies.

    security_insights_value: # TODO

  - id: OSPS-VM-06
    maturity_level: 2
    criterion: |
      The project MUST provide a means for reporting 
      security vulnerabilities privately to the security
      contacts within the project.
    rationale: |
      Security vulnerabilities should not be shared with 
      the public until such time the project has been 
      provided time to analyze and prepare remediations
      to protect users of the project.
    details: |
       Enable private bug reporting through VCS or other
       infrastrucuture.
    control_mappings: # TODO    

  - id: OSPS-VM-07
    maturity_level: 2
    criterion: |
      The project MUST publicly publish data about vulnerabilities
      discovered within the codebase.
    rationale: |
      Consumers of the project must be informed about
      known vulnerabilities found within the project.

category: Access Control
description: |
  Access Control focuses on the mechanisms and
  policies that control access to the project's version
  control system and CI/CD pipelines. These controls help
  ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive
  data, modify repository settings, or execute build and
  release processes.

    title: |
      Protect against unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the project's 
      repository
    objective: |
      Reduce the risk of account compromise or insider threats by requiring
      multi-factor authentication for collaborators modifying the project
      repository settings or accessing sensitive data.

          The project's version control system MUST require multi-factor
          authentication for collaborators modifying the project repository
          settings or accessing sensitive data.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 1
          - Maturity Level 2
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Enforce multi-factor authentication for the project's version
          control system, requiring collaborators to provide a second form of
          authentication when accessing sensitive data or modifying repository
          settings. Passkeys are acceptable for this control.

      Limit the permissions granted to collaborators by default
    objective: |
      Reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the project's repository by
      limiting the permissions granted to new collaborators.

          The project's version control system MUST restrict collaborator
          permissions to the lowest available privileges by default.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 1
          - Maturity Level 2
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Most public version control systems are configured in this manner.
          Ensure the project's version control system always assigns the lowest
          available permissions to collaborators by default when added, granting
          additional permissions only when necessary.

      Protect the primary branch from unintentional or unauthorized changes
    objective: |
      Reduce the risk of accidental changes or deletion of the primary branch
      of the project's repository by preventing unintentional modification.

          The project's version control system MUST prevent unintentional direct
          commits against the primary branch.

          - Maturity Level 1
          - Maturity Level 2
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          If the VCS is centralized, set branch protection on the primary branch
          in the project's VCS. Alternatively, use a decentralized approach,
          like the Linux kernel's, where changes are first proposed in another
          repository, and merging changes into the primary repository requires a
          specific separate act.

          Set branch protection on the primary branch in the project's version
          control system to prevent deletion.

      processes by limiting the permissions granted to steps within the CI/CD
      pipelines.

          The project's permissions in CI/CD pipelines MUST be configured to the
          lowest available privileges except when explicitly elevated.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 2
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Configure the project's CI/CD pipelines to assign the lowest available
          permissions to users and services by default, elevating permissions
          only when necessary for specific tasks. In some version control
          systems, this may be possible at the organizational or repository
          level. If not, set permissions at the top level of the pipeline.

  criterion: |
    The project documentation MUST provide user
    guides for all basic functionality.
  rationale: |
    Ensure that users have a clear and
    comprehensive understanding of the project's
    current features in order to prevent damage
    from misuse or misconfiguration.
  details: |
    Create user guides or documentation for all
    basic functionality of the project,
    explaining how to install, configure, and
    use the project's features. If there are any
    known dangerous or destructive actions
    available, include highly-visible warnings.

  maturity_level: 2
  category: Documentation
  criterion: |
    The project documentation MUST include a
    mechanism for reporting defects.
  rationale: |
    Enable users and contributors to report
    defects or issues with the released software
    assets, facilitating communication and
    collaboration on defect fixes and
    improvements.
  details: |
    It is recommended that projects use their
    VCS default issue tracker. If an extarnal
    source is used, ensure that the project
    documentation and contributing guide clearly
    and visibly explain how to use the reporting
    system.

    It is recommended that project documentation
    also sets expectations for how defects will
    be triaged and resolved.

  category: Documentation
  criterion: |
    The project documentation MUST provide
    design documentation demonstrating all
    actions and actors within the system.
  rationale: |
    Provide an overview of the project's design
    and architecture, illustrating the
    interactions and components of the system to
    help contributors and security reviewers
    understand the internal logic of the
    released software assets.
  details: |
    Include designs in the project documentation
    that explains the actions and actors. Actors
    include any subsystem or entity that can
    influence another segment in the system.

  category: Documentation
  criterion: |
    The project documentation MUST include
    descriptions of all external input and output
    interfaces of the released software assets.
  rationale: |
    Provide users and developers with an
    understanding of how to interact with the
    project's software and integrate it with
    other systems, enabling them to use the
    software effectively.
  details: |
    Document all input and output interfaces of
    the released software assets, explaining how
    users can interact with the software and
    what data is expected or produced.

  category: Documentation
  criterion: |
    The project documentation MUST contain
    instructions to verify the integrity 
    and authenticity of the release assets,
    including the expected identity of the person
    or process authoring the software release.
  rationale: |
    Enable users to verify the authenticity and
    integrity of the project's released software
    assets, reducing the risk of using tampered
    or unauthorized versions of the software.
  details: |
    Instructions in the project should contain
    information about the technology used, the
    commands to run, and the expected output. The 
    expected identity may be in the form of key
    IDs used to sign, issuer and identity from a
    sigstore certificate, or other similar forms.

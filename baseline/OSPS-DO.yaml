  Documentation criteria focus on the information
  provided to users, contributors, and maintainers
  of the project. These criteria help ensure that
  the project's documentation is comprehensive,
  accurate, and up-to-date, enabling users to
  understand the project's features and functionality.
criteria:
  - id: OSPS-DO-03
    maturity_level: 1
    category: Documentation
    criterion: |
      The project documentation MUST provide user
      guides for all basic functionality.
    rationale: |
      Ensure that users have a clear and
      comprehensive understanding of the project's
      current features in order to prevent damage
      from misuse or misconfiguration.
    details: |
      Create user guides or documentation for all
      basic functionality of the project,
      explaining how to install, configure, and
      use the project's features. If there are any
      known dangerous or destructive actions
      available, include highly-visible warnings.

    category: Documentation
    criterion: |
      The project documentation MUST include a
      mechanism for reporting defects.
    rationale: |
      Enable users and contributors to report
      defects or issues with the released software
      assets, facilitating communication and
      collaboration on defect fixes and
      improvements.
    details: |
      It is recommended that projects use their
      VCS default issue tracker. If an extarnal
      source is used, ensure that the project
      documentation and contributing guide clearly
      and visibly explain how to use the reporting
      system.

      It is recommended that project documentation
      also sets expectations for how defects will
      be triaged and resolved.

    category: Documentation
    criterion: |
      The project documentation MUST contain
      instructions to verify the integrity 
      and authenticity of the release assets,
      including the expected identity of the person
      or process authoring the software release.
    rationale: |
      Enable users to verify the authenticity and
      integrity of the project's released software
      assets, reducing the risk of using tampered
      or unauthorized versions of the software.
    details: |
      Instructions in the project should contain
      information about the technology used, the
      commands to run, and the expected output. The 
      expected identity may be in the form of key
      IDs used to sign, issuer and identity from a
      sigstore certificate, or other similar forms.

    implementation: |
      The project should have either a "Support"
      header in the README, a SUPPORT.md file
      present in the repo root, or a SUPPORT.eox
      file in the [OpenEOX format](https://github.com/OpenEoX/openeox/blob/main/schema/schema.json)
      describing the scope and duration of support
      for the project's released software assets.

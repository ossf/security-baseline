          The project documentation MUST provide user guides for all basic
          functionality.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 1
          - Maturity Level 2
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Create user guides or documentation for all basic functionality of the
          project, explaining how to install, configure, and use the project's
          features. If there are any known dangerous or destructive actions
          available, include highly-visible warnings.

      Include a mechanism for reporting defects in the project documentation
    objective: |
      Enable users and contributors to report defects or issues with the
      released software assets, facilitating communication and collaboration on
      defect fixes and improvements.

          The project documentation MUST include a mechanism for reporting
          defects.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 1
          - Maturity Level 2
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          It is recommended that projects use their VCS default issue tracker.
          If an external source is used, ensure that the project documentation
          and contributing guide clearly and visibly explain how to use the
          reporting system. It is recommended that project documentation also
          sets expectations for how defects will be triaged and resolved.

      Include instructions to verify the integrity and authenticity of release
      assets in the project documentation
    objective: |
      Enable users to verify the authenticity and integrity of the project's
      released software assets, reducing the risk of using tampered or
      unauthorized versions of the software.

          The project documentation MUST contain instructions to verify the
          integrity and authenticity of the release assets, including the
          expected identity of the person or process authoring the software
          release.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Instructions in the project should contain information about the
          technology used, the commands to run, and the expected output. The
          expected identity may be in the form of key IDs used to sign, issuer
          and identity from a sigstore certificate, or other similar forms.
          When possible, avoid storing this documentation in the same location
          as the build and release pipeline to avoid a single breach
          compromising both the software and the documentation for verifying the
          integrity of the software.

      Include a descriptive statement about the scope and duration of support
      in the project documentation
    objective: |
      Provide users with clear expectations regarding the project's support
      lifecycle. This allows downstream consumers to take relevant actions to
      ensure the continued functionality and security of their systems.

          The project documentation MUST include a descriptive statement about
          the scope and duration of support.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          In order to communicate the scope and duration of support for the
          project's released software assets, the project should have a
          SUPPORT.md or an OpenEoX file in a well known location.

    title: |
      Provide a descriptive statement when releases or versions will no longer
      receive security updates in the project documentation
    objective: |
      Communicating when the project maintainers will no longer fix defects or
      security vulnerabilities is crucial for downstream consumers to find
      alternative solutions or alternative means of support for the project.

          releases or versions will no longer receive security updates.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          While a machine-readable OpenEoX file is recommended, this may also be
          communicated in a SUPPORT.md or beneath a Support header in the
          primary README.md.

      Describe how the project selects, obtains, and tracks its dependencies in
      the project documentation
    objective: |
      Provide information about how the project selects, obtains, and tracks
      dependencies, libraries, frameworks, etc. to help downstream consumers
      understand how the project operates in regards to third-party components
      that are required necessary for the software to function.

        recommendation: |
          It is recommended to publish this information alongside the project's
          technical & design documentation on a publicly viewable resource such
          as the source code repository, project website, or other channel.

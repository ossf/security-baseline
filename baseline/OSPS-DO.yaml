        recommendation: |
          It is recommended that projects use their VCS default issue tracker.
          If an external source is used, ensure that the project documentation
          and contributing guide clearly and visibly explain how to use the
          reporting system. It is recommended that project documentation also
          sets expectations for how defects will be triaged and resolved.

      The project documentation MUST contain instructions to verify the
      integrity and authenticity of the release assets, including the
      expected identity of the person or process authoring the software
      release.
    objective: |
      Enable users to verify the authenticity and integrity of the project's
      released software assets, reducing the risk of using tampered or
      unauthorized versions of the software.

        recommendation: |
          Instructions in the project should contain information about the
          technology used, the commands to run, and the expected output.
          When possible, avoid storing this documentation in the same location
          as the build and release pipeline to avoid a single breach
          compromising both the software and the documentation for verifying the
          integrity of the software.

        recommendation: |
          In order to communicate the scope and duration of support for the

          SUPPORT.md file, a "Support" section in SECURITY.md, or
          other documentation explaining the support lifecycle,
          including the expected duration of support for each release, the
          types of support provided (e.g., bug fixes, security updates), and
          any relevant policies or procedures for obtaining support.

    objective: |
      Communicating when the project maintainers will no longer fix defects or
      security vulnerabilities is crucial for downstream consumers to find
      alternative solutions or alternative means of support for the project.

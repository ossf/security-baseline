    url: https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/main/criteria/criteria.yml
    description: "The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices Badge is a way for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects to show that they follow best practices. Projects can voluntarily self-certify, at no cost, by using this web application to explain how they follow each best practice. The OpenSSF Best Practices Badge is inspired by the many badges available to projects on GitHub. Consumers of the badge can quickly assess which FLOSS projects are following best practices and, as a result, are more likely to produce higher-quality secure software."

    description: "The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides guidance to industry, government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks. It offers a taxonomy of high level cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by any organization — regardless of its size, sector, or maturity — to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts. The CSF does not prescribe how outcomes should be achieved. Rather, it links to online resources that provide additional guidance on practices and controls that could be used to achieve those outcomes."

    title: Secure Software Development Framework
    version: 1.1
    url: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final
    description: "The Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) is a set of fundamental, sound, and secure software development practices based on established secure software development practice documents from organizations such as BSA, OWASP, and SAFECode. Few software development life cycle (SDLC) models explicitly address software security in detail, so practices like those in the SSDF need to be added to and integrated with each SDLC implementation. Following the SSDF practices should help software producers reduce the number of vulnerabilities in released software, reduce the potential impact of the exploitation of undetected or unaddressed vulnerabilities, and address the root causes of vulnerabilities to prevent recurrences. Also, because the SSDF provides a common language for describing secure software development practices, software producers and acquirers can use it to foster their communications for procurement processes and other management activities."

    description: "The Proactive-Software Supply Chain Risk Management (P-SSCRM) Framework is designed to help you understand and plan a secure software supply chain risk management initiative. P-SSCRM was created through a process of understanding and analyzing real-world data from nine industry-leading software supply chain risk management initiatives as well as through the analysis and unification of ten government and industry documents, frameworks, and standards. Although individual methodologies and standards differ, many initiatives and standards share common ground. P-SSCRM describes this common ground and presents a model for understanding, quantifying, and developing a secure software supply chain risk management program and determining where your organization’s existing efforts stand when contrasted with other real-world software supply chain risk management initiatives."

The standards apply to all entities that store, process or transmit cardholder data – with requirements for software developers and manufacturers of applications and devices used in those transactions. The Council is responsible for managing the security standards, while compliance with the PCI set of standards is enforced by the founding members of the Council: American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB, MasterCard and Visa Inc. The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) applies to all entities that store, process, and/or transmit cardholder data. It covers technical and operational system components included in or connected to cardholder data. If you accept or process payment cards, PCI DSS applies to you."

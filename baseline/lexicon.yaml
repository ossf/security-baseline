- term: Arbitrary Code
  definition: |
    Code provided by an external source that is
    executed by a system without validation or
    restriction.
- term: Attack Surface Analysis
  definition: |
    Attack Surface Analysis is about mapping out what parts of a system need to
    be reviewed and tested for security vulnerabilities. The point of Attack
    Surface Analysis is to understand the risk areas in an application, to make
    developers and security specialists aware of what parts of the application
    are open to attack, to find ways of minimizing this, and to notice when and
    how the Attack Surface changes and what this means from a risk perspective.
    
    See OWASP's Attack Surface Analysis Cheat Sheet for more information.

- term: Automated Test Suite
  definition: |
    A collection of pre-written test cases that, when invoked,
    execute the software to verify that actual results are expected results
    without requiring manual intervention.
    An automated test suite must return an overall "pass" or "fail" result,
    and is often implemented using a test framework.
    Common ways to invoke automated tests include `make check`, `make test`, `npm test`, and `cargo test` manually or as part of a Continuous Integration workflow.

- term: Build and Release Pipeline
  definition: |

    checks.
  synonyms: 
    - Build and Release Pipelines
- term: Change
  definition: |

  definition: |
    Automated pipelines for Continuous
    Integration and Continuous Delivery.
    Responsible for building, testing, and

    reliable software delivery. CI focuses on
    testing and building code, while CD delivers
    software to location such as a package
    registry.

    In the context of the Open Source Project
    Security Baseline, CD refers only to
    continuous delivery, not to continuous
    deployment, as sometimes used elsewhere.
- term: Contributor License Agreement
  definition: |
    A legal agreement used to assign some of a contributor's
    rights covered by copyright laws to a project. This is

    Security Baseline, code contributors does not
    address non-code contributions such as
    designing, triaging, reviewing, or testing.
- term: Codebase
  definition: |
    The collection of source code and related
    assets that make up the project. The codebase
    includes all files necessary to build and

    sometimes alongside documentation and CI/CD
    pipelines. The contents of the codebase are
    the primary deliverable in a release.
- term: Collaborator
  definition: |
    A human or non-human entity with permissions to
    approve changes or manage the repository settings.
    Collaborators may have varying permission levels based on
    their role in the project. This does not
    include contributors whose changes only
    originate through a request from a repository
    fork.
- term: Commit
  definition: |
    A record of a single change submitted to the
    version control system. Each commit includes
    details such as the modifications made, the
    contributor who made them, and the timestamp
    of the change.

- term: Arbitrary Code
  definition: |
    Code provided by an external source that is
    executed by a system without validation or
    restriction.
- term: Attack Surface Analysis
  definition: |
    Attack Surface Analysis is about mapping out what parts of a system need to
    be reviewed and tested for security vulnerabilities. The point of Attack
    Surface Analysis is to understand the risk areas in an application, to make
    developers and security specialists aware of what parts of the application
    are open to attack, to find ways of minimizing this, and to notice when and
    how the Attack Surface changes and what this means from a risk perspective.
    
    See OWASP's Attack Surface Analysis Cheat Sheet for more information.

- term: Automated Test Suite
  definition: |
    A collection of pre-written test cases that, when invoked,
    execute the software to verify that actual results are expected results
    without requiring manual intervention.
    An automated test suite must return an overall "pass" or "fail" result,
    and is often implemented using a test framework.
    Common ways to invoke automated tests include `make check`, `make test`, `npm test`, and `cargo test` manually or as part of a Continuous Integration workflow.
- term: Best Practices Badge
  definition: |

- term: Build and Release Pipeline
  definition: |
    A series of automated processes that compile
    and deploy software. Similar to the generic
    term CI/CD Pipelines, but this term excludes
    some pipelines, such as pre-merge status
    checks.
- term: Change
  definition: |
    Any alteration of the project's codebase,
    CI/CD Pipelines, or documentation. This may
    include addition, deletion, or modification
    of content.
- term: CI/CD Pipeline
  definition: |
    Automated pipelines for Continuous
    Integration and Continuous Delivery.
    Responsible for building, testing, and
    delivering changes. These pipelines integrate
    contributions frequently, enabling rapid and
    reliable software delivery. CI focuses on
    testing and building code, while CD delivers
    software to location such as a package
    registry.

    In the context of the Open Source Project
    Security Baseline, CD refers only to
    continuous delivery, not to continuous
    deployment, as sometimes used elsewhere.
- term: Contributor
  definition: |
    Entities who commit code or documentation to
    the project. Code contributors include
    collaborators or external participants who
    submit changes.

    In the context of the Open Source Project
    Security Baseline, code contributors does not
    address non-code contributions such as
    designing, triaging, reviewing, or testing.
- term: Codebase
  definition: |
    The collection of source code and related
    assets that make up the project. The codebase
    includes all files necessary to build and
    test the software. Lives in the repository,
    sometimes alongside documentation and CI/CD
    pipelines. The contents of the codebase are
    the primary deliverable in a release.
- term: Collaborator
  definition: |
    A user with a role on the project's version
    control system who can approve changes or
    manage the repository settings. Collaborators
    may have varying permission levels based on
    their role in the project. This does not
    include contributors whose changes only
    originate through a request from a repository
    fork.
- term: Commit
  definition: |
    A record of a single change submitted to the
    version control system. Each commit includes
    details such as the modifications made, the
    contributor who made them, and the timestamp
    of the change.
- term: Cyber Resilience Act
  definition: |
    Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 (Cyber Resilience Act, CRA).
    2024 European cybersecurity law that goes into full effect
    December 2027.  Focuses on products sold within the European
    Union and the cybersecurity and vulnerability management
    practices used to create and support the product.

    Errors or flaws in the software that cause it
    to produce incorrect or unintended results, 
    or to behave in an unintended way. Defects
    can include bugs, vulnerabilities, or other
    issues that impact the software's
    functionality or security. Defects may have
    originally been intentional, but a change in
    environment or understanding has made them
    undesirable.
- term: Exploitable Vulnerabilities
  definition: |
    Defects in the software that can be leveraged
    by attackers to gain unauthorized access,
    execute arbitrary code, or cause other
    undesired outcomes.
  synonyms:

    `LICENSE/`. The license applies to repository
    contents and any released software assets,
    unless otherwise stated.
- term: Known Vulnerabilities
  definition: |
    Publicly acknowledged exploitable
    vulnerabilities that have been identified
    within the software. These vulnerabilities
    often have associated advisories, patches, or

    codebase must be automatically evaluated 
    against a documented policy for known
    vulnerabilities and blocked in the
    event of violations.
  synonyms:

- term: Multi-factor Authentication
  definition: |

    system be be broken or compromised.

    Each identified threat is listed out so the project
    can then think about how to proactively avoid or 
    close off any gaps/vulnerabilities that could arise.

- term: Arbitrary Code
  definition: |
    Code provided by an external source that is
    executed by a system without validation or
    restriction.
- term: Attack Surface Analysis
  definition: |
    Attack Surface Analysis is about mapping out what parts of a system need to
    be reviewed and tested for security vulnerabilities. The point of Attack
    Surface Analysis is to understand the risk areas in an application, to make
    developers and security specialists aware of what parts of the application
    are open to attack, to find ways of minimizing this, and to notice when and
    how the Attack Surface changes and what this means from a risk perspective.
    
    See OWASP's Attack Surface Analysis Cheat Sheet for more information.

- term: Automated Test Suite
  definition: |
    A collection of pre-written test cases that, when invoked,
    execute the software to verify that actual results are expected results
    without requiring manual intervention.
    An automated test suite must return an overall "pass" or "fail" result,
    and is often implemented using a test framework.
    Common ways to invoke automated tests include `make check`, `make test`, `npm test`, and `cargo test` manually or as part of a Continuous Integration workflow.
- term: Build and Release Pipeline
  definition: |
    A series of automated processes that compile
    and deploy software. Similar to the generic
    term CI/CD Pipelines, but this term excludes
    some pipelines, such as pre-merge status
    checks.
  synonyms: 
    - Build and Release Pipelines
- term: Change
  definition: |
    Any alteration of the project's codebase,
    CI/CD Pipelines, or documentation. This may
    include addition, deletion, or modification
    of content.
- term: CI/CD Pipeline
  definition: |
    Automated pipelines for Continuous
    Integration and Continuous Delivery.
    Responsible for building, testing, and
    delivering changes. These pipelines integrate
    contributions frequently, enabling rapid and
    reliable software delivery. CI focuses on
    testing and building code, while CD delivers
    software to location such as a package
    registry.

    In the context of the Open Source Project
    Security Baseline, CD refers only to
    continuous delivery, not to continuous
    deployment, as sometimes used elsewhere.
- term: Contributor License Agreement
  definition: |
    A legal agreement used to assign some of a contributor's
    rights covered by copyright laws to a project. This is
    often used to enable a project to make future changes to
    a work's license without requiring the assent of every
    contributor.
  synonyms:
    - CLA
- term: Contributor
  definition: |
    Entities who commit code or documentation to
    the project. This includes both human
    and non-human actors and makes no distinctions
    based on their role within the project.

    In the context of the Open Source Project
    Security Baseline, code contributors does not
    address non-code contributions such as
    designing, triaging, reviewing, or testing.
- term: Codebase
  definition: |
    The collection of source code and related
    assets that make up the project. The codebase
    includes all files necessary to build and
    test the software. Lives in the repository,
    sometimes alongside documentation and CI/CD
    pipelines. The contents of the codebase are
    the primary deliverable in a release.
- term: Collaborator
  definition: |
    A human or non-human entity with permissions to
    approve changes or manage the repository settings.
    Collaborators may have varying permission levels based on
    their role in the project. This does not
    include contributors whose changes only
    originate through a request from a repository
    fork.
- term: Commit
  definition: |
    A record of a single change submitted to the
    version control system. Each commit includes
    details such as the modifications made, the
    contributor who made them, and the timestamp
    of the change.
- term: Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure
  definition: |
    A process of gathering information from vulnerability finders, coordinating
    the sharing of that information between relevant stakeholders, and
    disclosing the existence of software vulnerabilities and their mitigations
    to various stakeholders including the public.

    to produce incorrect or unintended results, 
    or to behave in an unintended way. Defects
    can include bugs, vulnerabilities, or other
    issues that impact the software's
    functionality or security. Defects may have
    originally been intentional, but a change in
    environment or understanding has made them
    undesirable.
- term: Developer Certificate of Origin
  definition: |
    An assertion made by a contributor that they have the
    legal right to make a specific contribution to a
    project. This is often indicated by using the
    `--signoff` option to `git commit`.

    All proposed changes to the project's
    codebase must be automatically evaluated 
    against a documented policy for known
    vulnerabilities and blocked in the
    event of violations.
  synonyms:
    - Known Vulnerability
- term: Multi-factor Authentication
  definition: |
    An authentication method that requires two or
    more verification factors (e.g., a password
    and a token) to gain access to a resource.
    This method strengthens security by requiring
    multiple forms of identification.
  synonyms:

    are not featured, a repository with forked
    repositories will have the original repo
    acting as an equivalent to the primary
    branch.
- term: Private Vulnerability Reporting

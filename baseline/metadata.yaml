    description: |
      The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices Badge is a way 
      for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects to show that they
      follow best practices. Projects can voluntarily self-certify, at no cost,
      by using this web application to explain how they follow each best practice.
      The OpenSSF Best Practices Badge is inspired by the many badges available
      to projects on GitHub. Consumers of the badge can quickly assess which
      FLOSS projects are following best practices and, as a result, are more
      likely to produce higher-quality secure software.

    description: |
      The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides guidance to industry,
      government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks.
      It offers a taxonomy of high level cybersecurity outcomes that can be used
      by any organization — regardless of its size, sector, or maturity — to
      better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity
      efforts. The CSF does not prescribe how outcomes should be achieved.
      Rather, it links to online resources that provide additional guidance on
      practices and controls that could be used to achieve those outcomes.

    description: |
      PCI Security Standards are technical and operational requirements
      set by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) to protect cardholder
      data. The standards apply to all entities that store, process or transmit
      cardholder data – with requirements for software developers and manufacturers
      of applications and devices used in those transactions. The Council is
      responsible for managing the security standards, while compliance with the
      PCI set of standards is enforced by the founding members of the Council:
      American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB, MasterCard and Visa Inc.
      The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) applies to all entities that store,
      process, and/or transmit cardholder data. It covers technical and operational
      system components included in or connected to cardholder data. If you accept
      or process payment cards, PCI DSS applies to you.

      A maturity model for software assurance that provides an effective
      and measurable way for all types of organizations to analyze and improve their
      software security posture. OWASP SAMM supports the complete software lifecycle,
      including development and acquisition, and is technology and process agnostic.
      It is intentionally built to be evolutive and risk-driven in nature.

    title: NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SP 800-218)
    version: "1.1"
    url: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final
    description: |
      The Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) is a set of fundamental,
      sound, and secure software development practices based on established
      secure software development practice documents from organizations such as
      BSA, OWASP, and SAFECode. Few software development life cycle (SDLC) models
      explicitly address software security in detail, so practices like those in
      the SSDF need to be added to and integrated with each SDLC implementation.
      Following the SSDF practices should help software producers reduce the
      number of vulnerabilities in released software, reduce the potential impact
      of the exploitation of undetected or unaddressed vulnerabilities, and
      address the root causes of vulnerabilities to prevent recurrences. Also,
      because the SSDF provides a common language for describing secure software
      development practices, software producers and acquirers can use it to foster
      their communications for procurement processes and other management activities.

      SLSA (pronounced \"salsa\") is a security framework from source
      to service, giving anyone working with software a common language for
      increasing levels of software security and supply chain integrity. It’s how
      you get from safe enough to being as resilient as possible, at any link in
      the chain.

    description: |
      The Proactive-Software Supply Chain Risk Management (P-SSCRM) Framework is
      designed to help you understand and plan a secure software supply chain risk
      management initiative. P-SSCRM was created through a process of understanding
      and analyzing real-world data from nine industry-leading software supply chain
      risk management initiatives as well as through the analysis and unification
      of ten government and industry documents, frameworks, and standards. Although
      individual methodologies and standards differ, many initiatives and standards
      share common ground. P-SSCRM describes this common ground and presents a model
      for understanding, quantifying, and developing a secure software supply chain
      risk management program and determining where your organization's existing
      efforts stand when contrasted with other real-world software supply chain
      risk management initiatives.

    description: |
      This voluntary Software Security Code of Practice has been developed to
      improve the security and resilience of software that organisations and
      businesses rely on.  
      The Software Security Code of Practice will support software vendors and
      their customers in reducing the likelihood and impact of software supply
      chain attacks and other software resilience incidents. Often, these kinds
      of attacks and disruptions are caused by avoidable weaknesses in software
      development and maintenance practices. The impact of these kinds of incidents
      can also be exacerbated by poor communication between organisations and
      their software suppliers. This Code addresses those issues.

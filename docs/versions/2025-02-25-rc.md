## Overview

The Open Source Project Security (OSPS) Baseline is a set of security criteria that projects should meet to demonstrate a strong security posture.
The controls are organized by maturity level and category.
In the detailed subsections you will find the control, rationale, and details notes.


Where possible, we have added control mappings to external frameworks.
These are not guaranteed to be 100% matches, but instead serve as references
when working to meet the corresponding controls.

For more information on the project and to make contributions, visit the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ossf/security-baseline).

**Requirement:** The project&#39;s [version control system] MUST prevent unintentional direct [commits] against the [primary branch]. 

**Recommendation:** If the VCS is centralized, set branch protection on the primary branch
in the project&#39;s VCS. Alternatively, use a decentralized approach,
like the Linux kernel&#39;s, where changes are first proposed in another
repository, and merging changes into the primary repository requires a
specific separate act.

project&#39;s software. These controls help ensure that the
project&#39;s build and release pipelines are secure,
consistent, and reliable, reducing the risk of
vulnerabilities or errors in the software distribution
process.




### OSPS-BR-01 - Prevent untrusted input from accessing privileged resources 

Reduce the risk of code injection or other security vulnerabilities in the
project&#39;s build and release pipelines by preventing untrusted input from
accessing privileged resources.




#### OSPS-BR-01.01

**Requirement:** The project&#39;s [build and release pipelines] MUST NOT permit untrusted input that allows access to privileged resources.

## Lexicon


### Arbitrary Code

Code provided by an external source that is
executed by a system without validation or
restriction.




### Attack Surface Analysis

Attack Surface Analysis is about mapping out what parts of a system need to
be reviewed and tested for security vulnerabilities. The point of Attack
Surface Analysis is to understand the risk areas in an application, to make
developers and security specialists aware of what parts of the application
are open to attack, to find ways of minimizing this, and to notice when and
how the Attack Surface changes and what this means from a risk perspective.

See OWASP&#39;s Attack Surface Analysis Cheat Sheet for more information.



**References:**

  - https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Attack_Surface_Analysis_Cheat_Sheet.html


### Automated Test Suite

A collection of pre-written test cases that, when invoked,
execute the software to verify that actual results are expected results
without requiring manual intervention.
An automated test suite must return an overall &#34;pass&#34; or &#34;fail&#34; result,
and is often implemented using a test framework.
Common ways to invoke automated tests include `make check`, `make test`, `npm test`, and `cargo test` manually or as part of a Continuous Integration workflow.




### Best Practices Badge

The OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Identifies FLOSS best practices &amp; implements a badging system for those practices.

### Build and Release Pipeline

A series of automated processes that compile
and deploy software. Similar to the generic
term CI/CD Pipelines, but this term excludes
some pipelines, such as pre-merge status
checks.




### Change

Any alteration of the project&#39;s codebase,
CI/CD Pipelines, or documentation. This may
include addition, deletion, or modification
of content.




### CI/CD Pipeline

Automated pipelines for Continuous
Integration and Continuous Delivery.
Responsible for building, testing, and
delivering changes. These pipelines integrate
contributions frequently, enabling rapid and
reliable software delivery. CI focuses on
testing and building code, while CD delivers
software to location such as a package
registry.

In the context of the Open Source Project
Security Baseline, CD refers only to
continuous delivery, not to continuous
deployment, as sometimes used elsewhere.




### Contributor

Entities who commit code or documentation to
the project. Code contributors include
collaborators or external participants who
submit changes.

In the context of the Open Source Project
Security Baseline, code contributors does not
address non-code contributions such as
designing, triaging, reviewing, or testing.




### Codebase

The collection of source code and related
assets that make up the project. The codebase
includes all files necessary to build and
test the software. Lives in the repository,
sometimes alongside documentation and CI/CD
pipelines. The contents of the codebase are
the primary deliverable in a release.




### Collaborator

A user with a role on the project&#39;s version
control system who can approve changes or
manage the repository settings. Collaborators
may have varying permission levels based on
their role in the project. This does not
include contributors whose changes only
originate through a request from a repository
fork.




### Commit

A record of a single change submitted to the
version control system. Each commit includes
details such as the modifications made, the
contributor who made them, and the timestamp
of the change.




### Cyber Resilience Act

Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 (Cyber Resilience Act, CRA).
2024 European cybersecurity law that goes into full effect
December 2027.  Focuses on products sold within the European
Union and the cybersecurity and vulnerability management
practices used to create and support the product.

  - https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj


### Cybersecurity Framework

The NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF) helps organizations understand and improve their management of cybersecurity risk.



**References:**

  - https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework

  - https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.CSWP.29


### Defect

Errors or flaws in the software that cause it
to produce incorrect or unintended results, 
or to behave in an unintended way. Defects
can include bugs, vulnerabilities, or other
issues that impact the software&#39;s
functionality or security. Defects may have
originally been intentional, but a change in
environment or understanding has made them
undesirable.




### OpenEoX

An initiative aimed at standardizing the way
End-of-Life and End-of-Support information is 
exchanged within the software and hardware industries.
Covering both vendors and open-source maintainers,
OpenEoX strives to provide a transparent, efficient, 
and unified approach to managing product lifecycles.



**References:**

  - https://openeox.org/


### Exploitable Vulnerabilities

Defects in the software that can be leveraged
by attackers to gain unauthorized access,
execute arbitrary code, or cause other
undesired outcomes.




### License

A legal document that defines the terms under
which the software can be used, modified, and
distributed. May be stored at the top level
of the repository in a file named `LICENSE`
or within files in a directory named
`LICENSE/`. The license applies to repository
contents and any released software assets,
unless otherwise stated.




### Known Vulnerabilities

Publicly acknowledged exploitable
vulnerabilities that have been identified
within the software. These vulnerabilities
often have associated advisories, patches, or
recommended mitigations.

All proposed changes to the project&#39;s
codebase must be automatically evaluated 
against a documented policy for known
vulnerabilities and blocked in the
event of violations.




### Multi-factor Authentication

An authentication method that requires two or
more verification factors (e.g., a password
and a token) to gain access to a resource.
This method strengthens security by requiring
multiple forms of identification.




### OpenChain

A Linux Foundation project that oversee two ISO/IEC standards to better understand and manage software supply chains. 



**References:**

  - https://openchainproject.org/

  - https://openchainproject.org/license-compliance


### OpenCRE

An OWASP project that converts cybersecurity requirements into a hierchical, machine-readable format.



**References:**

  - https://www.opencre.org/

  - https://zeljkoobrenovic.github.io/opencre-explorer/


### Primary Branch

The main development branch in the version
control system, representing the latest
stable codebase. Releases are typically made
from this branch. Commonly named `main` or
`master`. In some situations where branches
are not featured, a repository with forked
repositories will have the original repo
acting as an equivalent to the primary
branch.




### Project Documentation

Written materials related to the project,
such as user guides, developer guides, and
contribution guidelines. These documents help
users and developers understand, contribute
to, and interact with the software. At
release time, this may include provenance
information, licensing details, and other
metadata.




### Software Provenance

Information about the origin and history of
the released software assets. This may
include details about its development,
dependencies, vulnerabilities, contributors,
and licensing.




### Release

- _(verb)_ The process of making a version
controlled bundle of assets available to
users, such as through a package registry.
- _(noun)_ A version-controlled bundle of
code, documentation, and other assets made
available to users. A release often includes
release notes that describe the changes.




### Released Software Asset

Deliverables provided to users as part of a
release. These assets can include binaries,
libraries, or containers.




### Repository

A storage location managed by a version
control system where the project&#39;s code,
documentation, and other resources are
stored. It tracks changes, manages
collaborator permissions, and includes
configuration options such as branch
protection and access controls.




### Secure Software Development Framework

The NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SP 800-218) is a broadly reviewed and collaborative set of fundamental secure software development practices.



**References:**

  - https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/ssdf

  - https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final


### Software Bill of Materials

A list of all components that make up a given piece of software
or hardware, formatted as CycloneDX or SPDX. This list must include
the following data elements for the components included in the released
software asset: license, supplier name, filename of the component,
component name, component version, software identifiers, relationship
between the components, author of the SBOM data and timestamp. Additionally,
for deployable and executable components, the SBOM should record their
cryptographic hashes.

### Software Composition Analysis

The process of identifying and cataloging all
components and dependencies in a software
codebase. SCA is essential for managing
security vulnerabilities and ensuring
compliance with organizational policies.




### Status Check

Automated tests or validations that run on
commits before they are merged. Status checks
ensure that any changes meet the project&#39;s
quality and security standards.




### Subproject

A codebase that is part of the project but
maintained in a separate repository.
Subprojects may be compiled into the primary
project or used as standalone components.




### Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts

An OpenSSF project that sets guidelines for securing software supply chain infrastrucutre and artifact integrity. 



**References:**

  - https://openssf.org/projects/slsa/

  - https://slsa.dev/


### Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is an activity where the project
looks at the codebase, associated processes and 
infrastructure, interfaces, key components and 
&#34;thinks like a hacker&#34; to brainstorm how the 
system be be broken or compromised.

Each identified threat is listed out so the project
can then think about how to proactively avoid or 
close off any gaps/vulnerabilities that could arise.

Examples of threat modeling methodologies include
the Shostack &#34;4 Questions&#34; model, STRIDE, and
tools such as the Elevation of Privilege Threat
Modeling Card Game or Threat Dragon.

### Version Identifier

A label assigned to a specific release of the
software, such as `v1.2.3`. Commonly
recommended formats are Semantic Versioning
or Calendar Versioning.




### Version Control System

A tool that tracks changes to files over time
and facilitates collaboration among
contributors. Examples of version control
systems include Git, Subversion, and
Mercurial.




### Vulnerability Reporting

The act of identifying and documenting
exploitable vulnerabilities in released
software assets. This may include privately
or openly reporting vulnerabilities to
maintainers, security teams, or the public,
as well as tracking the resolution of these
vulnerabilities.

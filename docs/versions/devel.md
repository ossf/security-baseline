## Overview

The Open Source Project Security (OSPS) Baseline is a set of security criteria that projects should meet to be considered secure.
The criteria are organized by maturity level and category.
In the detailed subsections you will find the criterion, rationale, and details notes.


Where possible, we have added control mappings to external frameworks.
These are not guaranteed to be 100% matches, but instead serve as references
when working to meet the corresponding controls.

For more information on the project and to make contributions, visit the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ossf/security-baseline).

## Access Control

Access Control criteria focus on the mechanisms and
policies that control access to the project's version
control system and CI/CD pipelines. These criteria help
ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive
data, modify repository settings, or execute build and
release processes.


### OSPS-AC-01

**Criterion:** The project's [version control system] MUST
require [multi-factor authentication] for
[collaborators] modifying the project
[repository] settings or accessing sensitive
data.


**Maturity Level:** 1

**Rationale:** Protect against unauthorized access to
sensitive areas of the project's [repository],
reducing the risk of account compromise or
insider threats. Passwords are often easily captured,
either during communication or on servers,
so depending solely on passwords is a weaker
form of authentication.


**Details:** Require [multi-factor authentication] ([MFA]) for the
project's [version control system], requiring
[collaborators] to provide a second form of
authentication when accessing sensitive data
or modifying [repository] settings.
Passkeys are acceptable for this criterion.

---

### OSPS-AC-02

**Criterion:** The project's [version control system] MUST
restrict [collaborator] permissions to the
lowest available privileges by default.


**Maturity Level:** 1

**Rationale:** Reduce the risk of unauthorized access to
the project's [repository] by limiting the
permissions granted to [collaborators].


**Details:** Most public [version control systems] are configured
in this manner. Ensure the project's version control
system always assigns the lowest available
permissions to [collaborators] by default when
added, granting additional permissions only
when necessary.

| SSDF | PO3.2, PS1 |



---

### OSPS-AC-03

**Criterion:** The project's [version control system] MUST
prevent unintentional direct [commits] against
the [primary branch].


**Maturity Level:** 1

**Rationale:** Reduce the risk of accidental [changes] to the
[primary branch] of the project's [repository],
ensuring that due diligence is done before
[commits] are merged.

**Implementation:** If the [VCS] is centralized,
set branch protection on the [primary branch]
in the project's [VCS]

**Details:** Set branch protection on the [primary branch]
in the project's [version control system]
requiring [changes] to be made through
pull/merge requests or other review
mechanisms.
Alternatively, use a decentralized approach
(like the Linux kernel's) where [changes] are
first proposed in another [repository], and
merging [changes] into the primary [repository]
requires a specific separate act.

| SSDF | PO3.2, PS1 |



---

### OSPS-AC-04

**Criterion:** The project's [version control system] MUST
prevent unintentional deletion of the
[primary branch].


**Maturity Level:** 1

**Rationale:** Protect the [primary branch] of the project's
[repository] from accidental deletion,
ensuring that the project's history and
[codebase] are preserved.


**Details:** Set branch protection on the [primary branch]
in the project's [version control system] to
prevent deletion.

| SSDF | PO3.2, PS1 |



---

### OSPS-AC-05

**Criterion:** The project's permissions in [CI/CD pipelines]
MUST be configured to the lowest available
privileges except when explicitly elevated.


**Maturity Level:** 2

**Rationale:** Reduce the risk of unauthorized access to
the project's build and [release] processes by
limiting the permissions granted to steps
within the [CI/CD pipelines].


**Details:** Configure the project's [CI/CD pipelines] to
assign the lowest available permissions to
users and services by default, elevating
permissions only when necessary for specific
tasks. In some [version control systems], this
may be possible at the organizational or
[repository] level. If not, set permissions at
the top level of the pipeline.

| SSDF | PO2, PO3.2, PS1 |



---

### OSPS-AC-07

**Criterion:** The project's [version control system] MUST
require [multi-factor authentication] that
does not include SMS for users when
modifying the project [repository] settings or
accessing sensitive data.


**Maturity Level:** 3

**Rationale:** Ensure that [multi-factor authentication]
does not allow SMS as a factor, because
SMS lacks encryption and may be vulnerable
to attacks via Signaling System 7,
social engineering, or SIM-swapping.


**Details:** Require [multi-factor authentication] methods
that do not include SMS for users. Common
alternatives include hardware tokens, mobile
authenticator apps, or biometric
authentication.

| SSDF | PO3.2, PS1 |



---

## Build and Release

Build and Release criteria focus on the processes and
tools used to compile, package, and distribute the
project's software. These criteria help ensure that the
project's build and release pipelines are secure,
consistent, and reliable, reducing the risk of
vulnerabilities or errors in the software distribution
process.


### OSPS-BR-01

**Criterion:** The project's [build and release pipelines]
MUST NOT permit untrusted input that allows
access to privileged resources.


**Maturity Level:** 1

**Rationale:** Reduce the risk of code injection or other
security vulnerabilities in the project's
build and [release] by preventing untrusted input
to access privileged resources
(secret exfiltration, final [release], etc.)


**Details:** Ensure that any integration or [release] pipeline actions
that accept externally-controlled untrusted input (e.g. git
branch names) do not use input in ways that could
provide unintended access to privileged resources.

| OCRE | 483-813, 124-564, 357-352 |
| SSDF | PO3.2, PS1 |



---

### OSPS-BR-02

**Criterion:** All [releases] and [released software assets]
MUST be assigned a unique version
identifier for each [release] intended to be
used by users.


**Maturity Level:** 2

**Rationale:** Ensure that each software asset produced by
the  project is uniquely identified,
enabling users to track [changes] and updates
to the project over time.


**Details:** Assign a unique [version identifier] to each
[release] and associated software asset
produced by the project, following a
consistent naming convention or numbering
scheme.
Examples include SemVer, CalVer, or
git [commit] id.

| SSDF | PO3.2, PS1 |



---

### OSPS-BR-04

**Criterion:** All [released software assets] MUST be created
with consistent, automated build and [release]
pipelines.


**Maturity Level:** 2

**Rationale:** Ensure that the project's software assets
are built and released using consistent and
automated processes, reducing the risk of
errors or inconsistencies in the deployment
and distribution of the software.

### OSPS-BR-05

**Criterion:** All [build and release pipelines] MUST use
standardized tooling where available to
ingest dependencies at build time.


**Maturity Level:** 2

**Rationale:** Ensure that the project's build and [release]
pipelines use standardized tools and
processes to manage dependencies, reducing
the risk of compatibility issues or security
vulnerabilities in the software.


**Details:** Use a common tooling for your ecosystem,
such as package managers or dependency
management tools to ingest dependencies at
build time. This may include using a

the software can be misused or broken allows them
to plan mitigations to close off the potential of 
those threats from occuring.

Providing downstream consumers with this threat model
can assist them in understanding the security capabilities
or gaps that exist within the project and allows them 
to apply their own additional controls and mitigations.

**Implementation:** [Threat modeling] is an activity where the project
looks at the [codebase], associated processes and 
infrastructure, interfaces, key components and 
"thinks like a hacker" and brainstorms how the 
system be be broken or compromised.

Each identified threat is listed out so the project
can then think about how to proactively avoid or 
close off any gaps/vulnerabilities that could arise.

### OSPS-SA-04

**Criterion:** The project MUST perform a security
assessment to understand the most likely and
impactful potential security problems that
could occur within the software.


**Maturity Level:** 2

**Rationale:** Performing a security assessment informs both project 
members as well as downstream consumers that the 
project understands what problems could arise within
the software.

Understanding what threats could be realized helps
the project manage and address risk.  This information
is useful to downstream consumers to demonstrate
the security accumen and practices of the project.

**Implementation:** Security assessments can take many forms in a spectrum
ranging from informal to highly rigourous.  At its most 
basic, a security assessment lists potential threats, 
estimates the likelihood/probability of those threats
occuring and the the possible consquences/impact if those
threats do occur.

Software that is deployed into highly-regulated spaces
would benefit from more formal risk management practices
such as [NIST SP 800-171](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf), 
[ENISA's Risk Management Framework](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/risk-management), 
or a methodolgy such as [OpenFAIR](https://www.opengroup.org/open-fair).

### OSPS-VM-05

**Criterion:** The project publishes contacts and process
for reporting vulnerabilities.


**Maturity Level:** 1

**Rationale:** Reports from researchers and users are an important source for
identifying vulnerabilities in a project. People with
vulnerabilities to report should have a clear understanding of
the process so that they can quickly submit the report to the
project.


**Details:** Create a security.md (or similarly-named) file that contains security 
contacts for the project and provide project's
process for handling vulnerabilities in the project or dependencies.

## Lexicon


### Arbitrary Code

Code provided by an external source that is
executed by a system without validation or
restriction.




### Attack Surface Analysis

Attack Surface Analysis is about mapping out what parts of a system need to
be reviewed and tested for security vulnerabilities. The point of Attack
Surface Analysis is to understand the risk areas in an application, to make
developers and security specialists aware of what parts of the application
are open to attack, to find ways of minimizing this, and to notice when and
how the Attack Surface changes and what this means from a risk perspective.

See OWASP's Attack Surface Analysis Cheat Sheet for more information.

### Automated Test Suite

A collection of pre-written test cases that, when invoked,
execute the software to verify that actual results are expected results
without requiring manual intervention.
An automated test suite must return an overall "pass" or "fail" result,
and is often implemented using a test framework.
Common ways to invoke automated tests include `make check`, `make test`, `npm test`, and `cargo test` manually or as part of a Continuous Integration workflow.




### Build and Release Pipeline

A series of automated processes that compile
and deploy software. Similar to the generic
term CI/CD Pipelines, but this term excludes
some pipelines, such as pre-merge status
checks.




### Change

Any alteration of the project's codebase,
CI/CD Pipelines, or documentation. This may
include addition, deletion, or modification
of content.




### CI/CD Pipeline

Automated pipelines for Continuous
Integration and Continuous Delivery.
Responsible for building, testing, and
delivering changes. These pipelines integrate
contributions frequently, enabling rapid and
reliable software delivery. CI focuses on
testing and building code, while CD delivers
software to location such as a package
registry.

In the context of the Open Source Project
Security Baseline, CD refers only to
continuous delivery, not to continuous
deployment, as sometimes used elsewhere.




### Contributor

Entities who commit code or documentation to
the project. Code contributors include
collaborators or external participants who
submit changes.

In the context of the Open Source Project
Security Baseline, code contributors does not
address non-code contributions such as
designing, triaging, reviewing, or testing.




### Codebase

The collection of source code and related
assets that make up the project. The codebase
includes all files necessary to build and
test the software. Lives in the repository,
sometimes alongside documentation and CI/CD
pipelines. The contents of the codebase are
the primary deliverable in a release.




### Collaborator

A user with a role on the project's version
control system who can approve changes or
manage the repository settings. Collaborators
may have varying permission levels based on
their role in the project. This does not
include contributors whose changes only
originate through a request from a repository
fork.




### Commit

A record of a single change submitted to the
version control system. Each commit includes
details such as the modifications made, the
contributor who made them, and the timestamp
of the change.




### Cyber Resilience Act

Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 (Cyber Resilience Act, CRA).
2024 European cybersecurity law that goes into full effect
December 2027.  Focuses on products sold within the European
Union and the cybersecurity and vulnerability management
practices used to create and support the product.

### Defect

Errors or flaws in the software that cause it
to produce incorrect or unintended results, 
or to behave in an unintended way. Defects
can include bugs, vulnerabilities, or other
issues that impact the software's
functionality or security. Defects may have
originally been intentional, but a change in
environment or understanding has made them
undesirable.




### Exploitable Vulnerabilities

Defects in the software that can be leveraged
by attackers to gain unauthorized access,
execute arbitrary code, or cause other
undesired outcomes.




### License

A legal document that defines the terms under
which the software can be used, modified, and
distributed. May be stored at the top level
of the repository in a file named `LICENSE`
or within files in a directory named
`LICENSE/`. The license applies to repository
contents and any released software assets,
unless otherwise stated.




### Known Vulnerabilities

Publicly acknowledged exploitable
vulnerabilities that have been identified
within the software. These vulnerabilities
often have associated advisories, patches, or
recommended mitigations.

All proposed changes to the project's
codebase must be automatically evaluated 
against a documented policy for known
vulnerabilities and blocked in the
event of violations.




### Multi-factor Authentication

An authentication method that requires two or
more verification factors (e.g., a password
and a token) to gain access to a resource.
This method strengthens security by requiring
multiple forms of identification.




### Primary Branch

The main development branch in the version
control system, representing the latest
stable codebase. Releases are typically made
from this branch. Commonly named `main` or
`master`. In some situations where branches
are not featured, a repository with forked
repositories will have the original repo
acting as an equivalent to the primary
branch.




### Project Documentation

Written materials related to the project,
such as user guides, developer guides, and
contribution guidelines. These documents help
users and developers understand, contribute
to, and interact with the software. At
release time, this may include provenance
information, licensing details, and other
metadata.




### Software Provenance

Information about the origin and history of
the released software assets. This may
include details about its development,
dependencies, vulnerabilities, contributors,
and licensing.




### Release

- _(verb)_ The process of making a version
controlled bundle of assets available to
users, such as through a package registry.
- _(noun)_ A version-controlled bundle of
code, documentation, and other assets made
available to users. A release often includes
release notes that describe the changes.




### Released Software Asset

Deliverables provided to users as part of a
release. These assets can include binaries,
libraries, or containers.




### Repository

A storage location managed by a version
control system where the project's code,
documentation, and other resources are
stored. It tracks changes, manages
collaborator permissions, and includes
configuration options such as branch
protection and access controls.




### Software Composition Analysis

The process of identifying and cataloging all
components and dependencies in a software
codebase. SCA is essential for managing
security vulnerabilities and ensuring
compliance with organizational policies.




### Status Check

Automated tests or validations that run on
commits before they are merged. Status checks
ensure that any changes meet the project's
quality and security standards.




### Subproject

A codebase that is part of the project but
maintained in a separate repository.
Subprojects may be compiled into the primary
project or used as standalone components.




### Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is an activity where the project
looks at the codebase, associated processes and 
infrastructure, interfaces, key components and 
"thinks like a hacker" to brainstorm how the 
system be be broken or compromised.

Each identified threat is listed out so the project
can then think about how to proactively avoid or 
close off any gaps/vulnerabilities that could arise.

Examples of threat modeling methodologies include
the Shostack "4 Questions" model, STRIDE, and
tools such as the Elevation of Privilege Threat
Modeling Card Game or Threat Dragon.

### Version Identifier

A label assigned to a specific release of the
software, such as `v1.2.3`. Commonly
recommended formats are Semantic Versioning
or Calendar Versioning.




### Version Control System

A tool that tracks changes to files over time
and facilitates collaboration among
contributors. Examples of version control
systems include Git, Subversion, and
Mercurial.




### Vulnerability Reporting

The act of identifying and documenting
exploitable vulnerabilities in released
software assets. This may include privately
or openly reporting vulnerabilities to
maintainers, security teams, or the public,
as well as tracking the resolution of these
vulnerabilities.

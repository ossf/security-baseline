## Overview

The Open Source Project Security (OSPS) Baseline is a set of security criteria that projects should meet to demonstrate a strong security posture.
The controls are organized by maturity level and category.
In the detailed subsections you will find the control, rationale, and details notes.

Where possible, we have added control mappings to external frameworks.
These are not guaranteed to be 100% matches, but instead serve as references
when working to meet the corresponding controls.

For more information on the project and to make contributions, visit the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ossf/security-baseline).

## Access Control

Access Control focuses on the mechanisms and
policies that control access to the project&#39;s version
control system and CI/CD pipelines. These controls help
ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive
data, modify repository settings, or execute build and
release processes.




### OSPS-AC-01 - The [project]&#39;s [version control system] MUST require multi-factor authentication for [users] modifying the [project] [repository] settings or accessing [sensitive data]. 

Reduce the risk of account compromise or insider threats by requiring
multi-factor authentication for collaborators modifying the project
repository settings or accessing sensitive data.




#### OSPS-AC-01.01

**Requirement:** When a [user] attempts to read or modify a [sensitive resource] in the [project]&#39;s authoritative [repository], the system MUST require the [user] to complete a [multi-factor authentication] process. 

**Recommendation:** Enforce multi-factor authentication for the project&#39;s version
control system, requiring collaborators to provide a second form of
authentication when accessing sensitive data or modifying repository
settings. Passkeys are acceptable for this control.


**Control applies to:**
- Maturity Level 1
- Maturity Level 2
- Maturity Level 3

---

### OSPS-AC-02 - The [project]&#39;s [version control system] MUST restrict [collaborator] permissions to the lowest available privileges by default. 

Reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the project&#39;s repository by
limiting the permissions granted to new collaborators.




#### OSPS-AC-02.01

**Requirement:** When a new [collaborator] is added, the [version control system] MUST require manual permission assignment, or restrict the [collaborator] permissions to the lowest available privileges by default. 

**Recommendation:** Most public version control systems are configured in this manner.
Ensure the project&#39;s version control system always assigns the lowest
available permissions to collaborators by default when added, granting
additional permissions only when necessary.

of the project&#39;s repository by preventing unintentional modification.




#### OSPS-AC-03.01

**Requirement:** When a direct [commit] is attempted on the [project]&#39;s [primary branch], an enforcement mechanism MUST prevent the [change] from being applied. 

**Recommendation:** If the VCS is centralized, set branch protection on the primary branch
in the project&#39;s VCS. Alternatively, use a decentralized approach,
like the Linux kernel&#39;s, where changes are first proposed in another
repository, and merging changes into the primary repository requires a
specific separate act.


**Control applies to:**
- Maturity Level 1
- Maturity Level 2
- Maturity Level 3




#### OSPS-AC-03.02

**Requirement:** When an attempt is made to delete the [project]&#39;s [primary branch], the [version control system] MUST treat this as a sensitive activity and require explicit confirmation of intent. 

**Recommendation:** Set branch protection on the primary branch in the project&#39;s version
control system to prevent deletion.


**Control applies to:**
- Maturity Level 1
- Maturity Level 2
- Maturity Level 3

### OSPS-AC-04 - The [project]&#39;s permissions in [CI/CD pipelines] MUST follow the principle of least privilege. 

Reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the project&#39;s build and release
processes by limiting the permissions granted to steps within the CI/CD
pipelines.




#### OSPS-AC-04.01

**Requirement:** When a CI/CD task is executed with no permissions specified, the CI/CD system MUST default the task&#39;s permissions to the lowest permissions granted in the pipeline. 

**Recommendation:** Configure the project&#39;s settings to assign the lowest available
permissions to new pipelines by default, granting additional
permissions only when necessary for specific tasks.


**Control applies to:**
- Maturity Level 2
- Maturity Level 3




#### OSPS-AC-04.02

**Requirement:** When a job is assigned permissions in a [CI/CD pipeline], the source [code] or configuration MUST only assign the minimum privileges necessary for the corresponding activity. 

**Recommendation:** Configure the project&#39;s CI/CD pipelines to assign the lowest available
permissions to users and services by default, elevating permissions
only when necessary for specific tasks. In some version control
systems, this may be possible at the organizational or repository
level. If not, set permissions at the top level of the pipeline.

#### OSPS-SA-03.01

**Requirement:** When the [project] has made a [release], the [project] MUST perform a security assessment to understand the most likely and impactful potential security problems that could occur within the software. 

**Recommendation:** Performing a security assessment informs both project members as well
as downstream consumers that the project understands what problems
could arise within the software. Understanding what threats could be
realized helps the project manage and address risk. This information
is useful to downstream consumers to demonstrate the security acumen
and practices of the project.
Ensure this is updated for new features or breaking changes.


**Control applies to:**
- Maturity Level 2
- Maturity Level 3




#### OSPS-SA-03.02

**Requirement:** When the [project] has made a [release], the [project] MUST perform a threat modeling and [attack surface analysis] to understand and protect against attacks on critical [code] paths, functions, and interactions within the system. 

**Recommendation:** Threat modeling is an activity where the project looks at the
codebase, associated processes and infrastructure, interfaces, key
components and &#34;thinks like a hacker&#34; and brainstorms how the system
be be broken or compromised. Each identified threat is listed out so
the project can then think about how to proactively avoid or close off
any gaps/vulnerabilities that could arise.
Ensure this is updated for new features or breaking changes.


**Control applies to:**
- Maturity Level 3

## External Frameworks

Controls within this document may map to the following external frameworks:

| ID | Title | Version | Description |
|----|-------|---------|-------------|
| BPB | [OpenSSF Best Practices Badge](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/main/criteria/criteria.yml) | 2024 | The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices Badge is a way for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects to show that they follow best practices. Projects can voluntarily self-certify, at no cost, by using this web application to explain how they follow each best practice. The OpenSSF Best Practices Badge is inspired by the many badges available to projects on GitHub. Consumers of the badge can quickly assess which FLOSS projects are following best practices and, as a result, are more likely to produce higher-quality secure software. |
| CSF | [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf) | 2 | The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides guidance to industry, government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks. It offers a taxonomy of high level cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by any organization — regardless of its size, sector, or maturity — to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts. The CSF does not prescribe how outcomes should be achieved. Rather, it links to online resources that provide additional guidance on practices and controls that could be used to achieve those outcomes. |
| CRA | [Cyber Resilience Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202402847#tit_1) | 20.11.2024 | Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2024 on horizontal cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements and amending Regulations (EU) No 168/2013 and (EU) 2019/1020 and Directive (EU) 2020/1828 (Cyber Resilience Act) (Text with EEA relevance) |
| SSDF | [Secure Software Development Framework](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final) | 1.1 | The Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) is a set of fundamental, sound, and secure software development practices based on established secure software development practice documents from organizations such as BSA, OWASP, and SAFECode. Few software development life cycle (SDLC) models explicitly address software security in detail, so practices like those in the SSDF need to be added to and integrated with each SDLC implementation. Following the SSDF practices should help software producers reduce the number of vulnerabilities in released software, reduce the potential impact of the exploitation of undetected or unaddressed vulnerabilities, and address the root causes of vulnerabilities to prevent recurrences. Also, because the SSDF provides a common language for describing secure software development practices, software producers and acquirers can use it to foster their communications for procurement processes and other management activities. |
| OC | [ISO/IEC 18974](https://openchainproject.org/security-assurance) | 1.0 - 2023-12 | ISO/IEC 18974 helps organizations check open source for known security vulnerability issues like CVEs, GitHub dependency alerts or package manager alerts. ISO/IEC 18974 identifies: The key places to have security processes, How to assign roles and responsibilities, And how to ensure sustainability of the processes. ISO/IEC 18974 is lightweight, easy to read and is supported by our global community with free reference material and conformance resources. |
| OCRE | [Open Cybersecurity Reference Architecture](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE) | 2024 | OpenCRE stands for Open Common Requirement enumeration. It is an interactive content linking platform for uniting security standards and guidelines. It offers easy and robust access to relevant information when designing, developing, testing and procuring secure software. |
| SLSA | [Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa) | 1 | SLSA (pronounced &#34;salsa&#34;) is a security framework from source to service, giving anyone working with software a common language for increasing levels of software security and supply chain integrity. It’s how you get from safe enough to being as resilient as possible, at any link in the chain. |
| PSSCRM | [Proactive Software Supply Chain Risk Management Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12300) | 1 | The Proactive-Software Supply Chain Risk Management (P-SSCRM) Framework is designed to help you understand and plan a secure software supply chain risk management initiative. P-SSCRM was created through a process of understanding and analyzing real-world data from nine industry-leading software supply chain risk management initiatives as well as through the analysis and unification of ten government and industry documents, frameworks, and standards. Although individual methodologies and standards differ, many initiatives and standards share common ground. P-SSCRM describes this common ground and presents a model for understanding, quantifying, and developing a secure software supply chain risk management program and determining where your organization’s existing efforts stand when contrasted with other real-world software supply chain risk management initiatives. |
| SAMM | [OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model](https://owaspsamm.org/model/) | 2 | The mission of OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is to be the prime maturity model for software assurance that provides an effective and measurable way for all types of organizations to analyze and improve their software security posture. OWASP SAMM supports the complete software lifecycle, including development and acquisition, and is technology and process agnostic. It is intentionally built to be evolutive and risk-driven in nature. |
| PCIDSS | [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard](https://docs-prv.pcisecuritystandards.org/PCI%20DSS/Standard/PCI-DSS-v4_0_1.pdf) | 4.0.1 | PCI Security Standards are technical and operational requirements set by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) to protect cardholder data. The standards apply to all entities that store, process or transmit cardholder data – with requirements for software developers and manufacturers of applications and devices used in those transactions. The Council is responsible for managing the security standards, while compliance with the PCI set of standards is enforced by the founding members of the Council: American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB, MasterCard and Visa Inc. The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) applies to all entities that store, process, and/or transmit cardholder data. It covers technical and operational system components included in or connected to cardholder data. If you accept or process payment cards, PCI DSS applies to you. |
| 800-161 | [NIST Special Publication 800-161 - Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-161r1-upd1.pdf) | r1-upd1 | This publication provides guidance to organizations on identifying, assessing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain at all levels of their organizations. The publication integrates cybersecurity supply chain risk management (C-SCRM) into risk management activities by applying a multilevel, C-SCRM-specific approach, including guidance on the development of C-SCRM strategy implementation plans, C-SCRM policies, C-SCRM plans, and risk assessments for products and services. |
| UKSSCOP | [United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre Software Security Code of Practice](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/software-security-code-of-practice-assurance-principles-claims) | 2025-05-07 | The Software Code of Practice has been created by DSIT and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the UK’s technical authority for cyber security, and is co-sealed by the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS). The Code reflects the government’s ongoing focus on codifying minimum standards for technology providers to reduce cyber risk. It is aimed at professionals who are responsible for overseeing the development of ‘commodity’ software, including technical, compliance, and risk experts. For those organisations that require a higher level of assurance in the resilience of their connected products and technology, consider using the NCSC’s Cyber Resilience Testing scheme. |

## Lexicon


### Administrator

Any human who can modify settings on the target resource.




### Arbitrary Code

Code provided by an external source that is
executed by a system without validation or
restriction.




### Attack Surface Analysis

Attack Surface Analysis is about mapping out what parts of a system need to
be reviewed and tested for security vulnerabilities. The point of Attack
Surface Analysis is to understand the risk areas in an application, to make
developers and security specialists aware of what parts of the application
are open to attack, to find ways of minimizing this, and to notice when and
how the Attack Surface changes and what this means from a risk perspective.

See OWASP&#39;s Attack Surface Analysis Cheat Sheet for more information.



**References:**

  - https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Attack_Surface_Analysis_Cheat_Sheet.html


### Automated Test Suite

A collection of pre-written test cases that, when invoked,
execute the software to verify that actual results are expected results
without requiring manual intervention.
An automated test suite must return an overall &#34;pass&#34; or &#34;fail&#34; result,
and is often implemented using a test framework.
Common ways to invoke automated tests include `make check`, `make test`, `npm test`, and `cargo test` manually or as part of a Continuous Integration workflow.




### Best Practices Badge

The OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Identifies FLOSS best practices &amp; implements a badging system for those practices.



**References:**

  - https://www.bestpractices.dev/en


### Build and Release Pipeline

A series of automated processes that compile
and deploy software. Similar to the generic
term CI/CD Pipelines, but this term excludes
some pipelines, such as pre-merge status
checks.




### Code

A set of deterministic instructions that a
computer can execute to perform specific tasks.




### Change

Any alteration of the project&#39;s codebase,
CI/CD Pipelines, or documentation. This may
include addition, deletion, or modification
of content.




### CI/CD Pipeline

Automated pipelines for Continuous
Integration and Continuous Delivery.
Responsible for building, testing, and
delivering changes. These pipelines integrate
contributions frequently, enabling rapid and
reliable software delivery. CI focuses on
testing and building code, while CD delivers
software to location such as a package
registry.

In the context of the Open Source Project
Security Baseline, CD refers only to
continuous delivery, not to continuous
deployment, as sometimes used elsewhere.




### Contributor License Agreement

A legal agreement used to assign some of a contributor&#39;s
rights covered by copyright laws to a project. This is
often used to enable a project to make future changes to
a work&#39;s license without requiring the assent of every
contributor.




### Contributor

Any entity that has made a change to the contents of a repository.




### Collaborator

Any entity who has any level of permissions issued by administrators

### Defect

Errors or flaws in the software that cause it
to produce incorrect or unintended results, 
or to behave in an unintended way. Defects
can include bugs, vulnerabilities, or other
issues that impact the software&#39;s
functionality or security. Defects may have
originally been intentional, but a change in
environment or understanding has made them
undesirable.




### Developer Certificate of Origin

An assertion made by a contributor that they have the
legal right to make a specific contribution to a
project. This is often indicated by using the
`--signoff` option to `git commit`.



**References:**

  - https://developercertificate.org/


### OpenEoX

and unified approach to managing product lifecycles.



**References:**

  - https://openeox.org/


### Exploitable Vulnerabilities

Defects in the software that can be leveraged
by attackers to gain unauthorized access,
execute arbitrary code, or cause other
undesired outcomes.




### License

A legal document that defines the terms under
which the software can be used, modified, and
distributed. May be stored at the top level
of the repository in a file named `LICENSE`
or within files in a directory named
`LICENSE/`. The license applies to repository
contents and any released software assets,
unless otherwise stated.




### Known Vulnerabilities

Publicly acknowledged exploitable
vulnerabilities that have been identified
within the software. These vulnerabilities
often have associated advisories, patches, or
recommended mitigations.

All proposed changes to the project&#39;s
codebase must be automatically evaluated 
against a documented policy for known
vulnerabilities and blocked in the
event of violations.




### Maintainer

A human collaborator who is able to authorize
changes to the contents of a repository.




### Multi-factor Authentication

An authentication method that requires two or
more verification factors (e.g., a password
and a token) to gain access to a resource.
This method strengthens security by requiring
multiple forms of identification.

### Primary Branch

The main development branch in the version
control system, representing the latest
stable codebase. Releases are typically made
from this branch. Commonly named `main` or
`master`. In some situations where branches
are not featured, a repository with forked
repositories will have the original repo
acting as an equivalent to the primary
branch.




### Private Vulnerability Reporting

The process of privately reporting a
vulnerability to the project maintainers or
security team before disclosing it publicly.
This allows the project to address the issue
before it becomes widely known.

  - https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability


### Proactive Software Supply Chain Risk Management Framework

A holistic framework that an organization can use to 
proactively mitigate software supply chain risk through 
guided adoption of tasks; and that supports assessment,
scoring, and comparison against industry peers, 
standards, and guidelines. The P-SSCRM contextualizes and
quantifies the tasks contained across multiple standards 
and frameworks to those carried out by various kinds of organizations.

### Project

A group of people and resources that coordinate to
produce a release.




### Project Documentation

Written materials related to the project,
such as user guides, developer guides, and
contribution guidelines. These documents help
users and developers understand, contribute
to, and interact with the software. At
release time, this may include provenance
information, licensing details, and other
metadata.




### Proactive Software Supply Chain Risk Management Framework

A maturity model for software assurance that provides an 
effective and measurable way for all types of organizations 
to analyze and improve their software security posture.

development and acquisition, and is technology and process agnostic. 
It is intentionally built to be evolutive and risk-driven in nature.



**References:**

  - https://owaspsamm.org/model/


### Sensitive Data

Information that, if disclosed to unauthorized
parties, would lead to unauthorized access,
data exfiltration, financial loss, or other
undesirable outcomes. This includes secrets
(like passwords, access tokens, etc.),
financial account information, personally
identifiable information (PII), and data about
embargoed vulnerabilities.




### Sensitive Resource

Resources that, if compromised, would provide a
vector for further compromising software build
and delivery or for disclosing sensitive data to
unauthorized parties. This includes build systems,
image repositories, and data storage.




### Software Provenance

or hardware, formatted as CycloneDX or SPDX. This list must include
the following data elements for the components included in the released
software asset: license, supplier name, filename of the component,
component name, component version, software identifiers, relationship
between the components, author of the SBOM data and timestamp. Additionally,
for deployable and executable components, the SBOM should record their
cryptographic hashes.

### Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is an activity where the project
looks at the codebase, associated processes and 
infrastructure, interfaces, key components and 
&#34;thinks like a hacker&#34; to brainstorm how the 
system be be broken or compromised.

Each identified threat is listed out so the project
can then think about how to proactively avoid or 
close off any gaps/vulnerabilities that could arise.

Examples of threat modeling methodologies include
the Shostack &#34;4 Questions&#34; model, STRIDE, and
tools such as the Elevation of Privilege Threat
Modeling Card Game or Threat Dragon.

### Version Identifier

A label assigned to a specific release of the
software, such as `v1.2.3`. Commonly
recommended formats are Semantic Versioning
or Calendar Versioning.




### User

A human making use of project resources, such as
the software, documentation, or other community
resources. This includes both end-users and
contributors.




### Version Control System

A tool that facilitates collaboration among
contributors by tracking changes, managing
collaborator permissions, and providing configuration
options. Examples of version control systems include
Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.




### Vulnerability Reporting

The act of identifying and documenting
exploitable vulnerabilities in released
software assets. This may include privately
or openly reporting vulnerabilities to
maintainers, security teams, or the public,
as well as tracking the resolution of these
vulnerabilities.

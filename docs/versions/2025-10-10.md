## Overview

The Open Source Project Security (OSPS) Baseline is a set of security criteria that projects should meet to demonstrate a strong security posture.
The controls are organized by maturity level and category.
In the detailed subsections you will find the control, rationale, and details notes.

Where possible, we have added control mappings to external frameworks.
These are not guaranteed to be 100% matches, but instead serve as references
when working to meet the corresponding controls.

For more information on the project and to make contributions, visit the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ossf/security-baseline).

control system and CI/CD pipelines. These controls help
ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive
data, modify repository settings, or execute build and
release processes.




### OSPS-AC-01 - The [project][Project]&#39;s [version control system][Version Control System] MUST require multi-factor authentication for [users][User] modifying the [project][Project] [repository][Repository] settings or accessing [sensitive data][Sensitive Data].


Reduce the risk of account compromise or insider threats by requiring
multi-factor authentication for collaborators modifying the project
repository settings or accessing sensitive data.




#### OSPS-AC-01.01

**Requirement:** When a [user][User] attempts to read or modify a [sensitive resource][Sensitive Resource] in the [project][Project]&#39;s authoritative [repository][Repository], the system MUST require the [user][User] to complete a [multi-factor authentication][Multi-factor Authentication] process.

**Recommendation:** 
Enforce multi-factor authentication for the project&#39;s version
control system, requiring collaborators to provide a second form of
authentication when accessing sensitive data or modifying repository
settings. Passkeys are acceptable for this control.



**Control applies to:**
- Maturity Level 1
- Maturity Level 2
- Maturity Level 3

Reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the project&#39;s repository by
limiting the permissions granted to new collaborators.




#### OSPS-AC-02.01

**Requirement:** When a new [collaborator][Collaborator] is added, the [version control system][Version Control System] MUST require manual permission assignment, or restrict the [collaborator][Collaborator] permissions to the lowest available privileges by default.

**Recommendation:** 
Most public version control systems are configured in this manner.
Ensure the project&#39;s version control system always assigns the lowest
available permissions to collaborators by default when added, granting

**Recommendation:** 
If the VCS is centralized, set branch protection on the primary branch
in the project&#39;s VCS. Alternatively, use a decentralized approach,
like the Linux kernel&#39;s, where changes are first proposed in another
repository, and merging changes into the primary repository requires a
specific separate act.

Configure the project&#39;s CI/CD pipelines to assign the lowest available
permissions to users and services by default, elevating permissions
only when necessary for specific tasks. In some version control
systems, this may be possible at the organizational or repository
level. If not, set permissions at the top level of the pipeline.

## External Frameworks

Controls within this document may map to the following external frameworks:

| ID | Title | Version | Description |
|----|-------|---------|-------------|
| BPB | [OpenSSF Best Practices Badge](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/main/criteria/criteria.yml) | 2024 | The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices Badge is a way for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects to show that they follow best practices. Projects can voluntarily self-certify, at no cost, by using this web application to explain how they follow each best practice. The OpenSSF Best Practices Badge is inspired by the many badges available to projects on GitHub. Consumers of the badge can quickly assess which FLOSS projects are following best practices and, as a result, are more likely to produce higher-quality secure software. |
| CSF | [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf) | 2 | The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides guidance to industry, government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks. It offers a taxonomy of high level cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by any organization — regardless of its size, sector, or maturity — to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts. The CSF does not prescribe how outcomes should be achieved. Rather, it links to online resources that provide additional guidance on practices and controls that could be used to achieve those outcomes. |
| CRA | [Cyber Resilience Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202402847#tit_1) | 20.11.2024 | Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2024 on horizontal cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements and amending Regulations (EU) No 168/2013 and (EU) 2019/1020 and Directive (EU) 2020/1828 (Cyber Resilience Act) (Text with EEA relevance) |
| SSDF | [Secure Software Development Framework](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final) | 1.1 | The Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) is a set of fundamental, sound, and secure software development practices based on established secure software development practice documents from organizations such as BSA, OWASP, and SAFECode. Few software development life cycle (SDLC) models explicitly address software security in detail, so practices like those in the SSDF need to be added to and integrated with each SDLC implementation. Following the SSDF practices should help software producers reduce the number of vulnerabilities in released software, reduce the potential impact of the exploitation of undetected or unaddressed vulnerabilities, and address the root causes of vulnerabilities to prevent recurrences. Also, because the SSDF provides a common language for describing secure software development practices, software producers and acquirers can use it to foster their communications for procurement processes and other management activities. |
| OC | [ISO/IEC 18974](https://openchainproject.org/security-assurance) | 1.0 - 2023-12 | ISO/IEC 18974 helps organizations check open source for known security vulnerability issues like CVEs, GitHub dependency alerts or package manager alerts. ISO/IEC 18974 identifies: The key places to have security processes, How to assign roles and responsibilities, And how to ensure sustainability of the processes. ISO/IEC 18974 is lightweight, easy to read and is supported by our global community with free reference material and conformance resources. |
| OCRE | [Open Cybersecurity Reference Architecture](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE) | 2024 | OpenCRE stands for Open Common Requirement enumeration. It is an interactive content linking platform for uniting security standards and guidelines. It offers easy and robust access to relevant information when designing, developing, testing and procuring secure software. |
| SLSA | [Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa) | 1 | SLSA (pronounced &#34;salsa&#34;) is a security framework from source to service, giving anyone working with software a common language for increasing levels of software security and supply chain integrity. It’s how you get from safe enough to being as resilient as possible, at any link in the chain. |
| PSSCRM | [Proactive Software Supply Chain Risk Management Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12300) | 1 | The Proactive-Software Supply Chain Risk Management (P-SSCRM) Framework is designed to help you understand and plan a secure software supply chain risk management initiative. P-SSCRM was created through a process of understanding and analyzing real-world data from nine industry-leading software supply chain risk management initiatives as well as through the analysis and unification of ten government and industry documents, frameworks, and standards. Although individual methodologies and standards differ, many initiatives and standards share common ground. P-SSCRM describes this common ground and presents a model for understanding, quantifying, and developing a secure software supply chain risk management program and determining where your organization’s existing efforts stand when contrasted with other real-world software supply chain risk management initiatives. |
| SAMM | [OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model](https://owaspsamm.org/model/) | 2 | The mission of OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is to be the prime maturity model for software assurance that provides an effective and measurable way for all types of organizations to analyze and improve their software security posture. OWASP SAMM supports the complete software lifecycle, including development and acquisition, and is technology and process agnostic. It is intentionally built to be evolutive and risk-driven in nature. |
| PCIDSS | [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard](https://docs-prv.pcisecuritystandards.org/PCI%20DSS/Standard/PCI-DSS-v4_0_1.pdf) | 4.0.1 | PCI Security Standards are technical and operational requirements set by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) to protect cardholder data. The standards apply to all entities that store, process or transmit cardholder data – with requirements for software developers and manufacturers of applications and devices used in those transactions. The Council is responsible for managing the security standards, while compliance with the PCI set of standards is enforced by the founding members of the Council: American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB, MasterCard and Visa Inc. The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) applies to all entities that store, process, and/or transmit cardholder data. It covers technical and operational system components included in or connected to cardholder data. If you accept or process payment cards, PCI DSS applies to you. |
| 800-161 | [NIST Special Publication 800-161 - Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-161r1-upd1.pdf) | r1-upd1 | This publication provides guidance to organizations on identifying, assessing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain at all levels of their organizations. The publication integrates cybersecurity supply chain risk management (C-SCRM) into risk management activities by applying a multilevel, C-SCRM-specific approach, including guidance on the development of C-SCRM strategy implementation plans, C-SCRM policies, C-SCRM plans, and risk assessments for products and services. |
| UKSSCOP | [United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre Software Security Code of Practice](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/software-security-code-of-practice-assurance-principles-claims) | 2025-05-07 | The Software Code of Practice has been created by DSIT and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the UK’s technical authority for cyber security, and is co-sealed by the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS). The Code reflects the government’s ongoing focus on codifying minimum standards for technology providers to reduce cyber risk. It is aimed at professionals who are responsible for overseeing the development of ‘commodity’ software, including technical, compliance, and risk experts. For those organisations that require a higher level of assurance in the resilience of their connected products and technology, consider using the NCSC’s Cyber Resilience Testing scheme. |

## Lexicon


### Administrator


Any human who can modify settings on the target resource.




### Arbitrary Code


Code provided by an external source that is
executed by a system without validation or
restriction.




### Attack Surface Analysis


Attack Surface Analysis is about mapping out what parts of a system need to
be reviewed and tested for security vulnerabilities. The point of Attack
Surface Analysis is to understand the risk areas in an application, to make
developers and security specialists aware of what parts of the application
are open to attack, to find ways of minimizing this, and to notice when and
how the Attack Surface changes and what this means from a risk perspective.

See OWASP&#39;s Attack Surface Analysis Cheat Sheet for more information.



**References:**

  - https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Attack_Surface_Analysis_Cheat_Sheet.html


### Automated Test Suite


A collection of pre-written test cases that, when invoked,
execute the software to verify that actual results are expected results
without requiring manual intervention.
An automated test suite must return an overall &#34;pass&#34; or &#34;fail&#34; result,
and is often implemented using a test framework.
Common ways to invoke automated tests include `make check`, `make test`, `npm test`, and `cargo test` manually or as part of a Continuous Integration workflow.




### Best Practices Badge


The OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Identifies FLOSS best practices &amp; implements a badging system for those practices.



**References:**

  - https://www.bestpractices.dev/en


### Build and Release Pipeline


A series of automated processes that compile
and deploy software. Similar to the generic
term CI/CD Pipelines, but this term excludes
some pipelines, such as pre-merge status
checks.




### Code


A set of deterministic instructions that a
computer can execute to perform specific tasks.




### Change


Any alteration of the project&#39;s codebase,
CI/CD Pipelines, or documentation. This may
include addition, deletion, or modification
of content.




### CI/CD Pipeline


Automated pipelines for Continuous
Integration and Continuous Delivery.
Responsible for building, testing, and
delivering changes. These pipelines integrate
contributions frequently, enabling rapid and
reliable software delivery. CI focuses on
testing and building code, while CD delivers
software to location such as a package
registry.

In the context of the Open Source Project
Security Baseline, CD refers only to
continuous delivery, not to continuous
deployment, as sometimes used elsewhere.




### Contributor License Agreement


A legal agreement used to assign some of a contributor&#39;s
rights covered by copyright laws to a project. This is
often used to enable a project to make future changes to
a work&#39;s license without requiring the assent of every
contributor.




### Contributor


Any entity that has made a change to the contents of a repository.




### Collaborator


Any entity who has any level of permissions issued by administrators
of the repository.




### Commit

version control system. Each commit includes
details such as the modifications made, the
contributor who made them, and the timestamp
of the change.




### Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure


A process of gathering information from vulnerability finders, coordinating
the sharing of that information between relevant stakeholders, and
disclosing the existence of software vulnerabilities and their mitigations
to various stakeholders including the public.

to produce incorrect or unintended results, 
or to behave in an unintended way. Defects
can include bugs, vulnerabilities, or other
issues that impact the software&#39;s
functionality or security. Defects may have
originally been intentional, but a change in
environment or understanding has made them
undesirable.




### Developer Certificate of Origin


An assertion made by a contributor that they have the
legal right to make a specific contribution to a
project. This is often indicated by using the
`--signoff` option to `git commit`.



**References:**

by attackers to gain unauthorized access,
execute arbitrary code, or cause other
undesired outcomes.




### License


A legal document that defines the terms under
which the software can be used, modified, and
distributed. May be stored at the top level
of the repository in a file named `LICENSE`
or within files in a directory named
`LICENSE/`. The license applies to repository
contents and any released software assets,
unless otherwise stated.




### Known Vulnerabilities


Publicly acknowledged exploitable
vulnerabilities that have been identified
within the software. These vulnerabilities
often have associated advisories, patches, or
recommended mitigations.

All proposed changes to the project&#39;s
codebase must be automatically evaluated 
against a documented policy for known
vulnerabilities and blocked in the
event of violations.




### Maintainer


A human collaborator who is able to authorize
changes to the contents of a repository.

system be be broken or compromised.

Each identified threat is listed out so the project
can then think about how to proactively avoid or 
close off any gaps/vulnerabilities that could arise.

Examples of threat modeling methodologies include
the Shostack &#34;4 Questions&#34; model, STRIDE, and
tools such as the Elevation of Privilege Threat
Modeling Card Game or Threat Dragon.

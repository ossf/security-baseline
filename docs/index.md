# Open Source Security Baseline

The Open Source Project Security Baseline (OSPS Baseline) is designed to act as a minimum definition of requirements for a project relative to it's maturity level.
It is maintained by the [OpenSSF Security Baseline SIG](https://github.com/ossf/security-baseline/blob/main/governance/MAINTAINERS.md) according to the [project governance documentation](https://github.com/ossf/security-baseline/blob/main/governance/GOVERNANCE.md).

For more information on the motivation and purpose, see the [FAQ](faq).

Any automated [status checks] for [commits] MUST
pass or require manual intervention prior to
merge.

**Objective:**

become accustomed to tolerating failing
[status checks], even if arbitrary, because it
increases the risk of overlooking security
vulnerabilities or [defects] identified by
automated checks.

**Implementation:**

Configure the project's version control
system to require that all automated status
checks pass or require manual intervention
before a [commit] can be merged into the

[subprojects] produced by the project are held
to a standard that clear and appropriate
for that [codebase].

**Implementation:**

The parent project should maintain a list of
any [codebases] that are considered
[subprojects] or additional [repositories].
[Collaborators] on those [repositories] should
identify the proper maturity level and apply
the Open Source Project Security Baseline to
the [codebase]. Any [subproject] or [repository]
which is compiled into the primary project
must be held to the same standard as the
primary project. Others may be held to a
lower standard if they have lower levels of
adoption or are not intended for general
use.

executable artifacts in the project's
[version control system], ensuring that only
source code and necessary files are stored
in the [repository].

**Implementation:**

Remove generated executable artifacts
in the project's [version control system].

It is recommended that any scenario where
a binary artifact appears critical to a
process such as testing, it should be stored
in a separate [repository] and fetched during
a specific well-documented pipeline step.

SMS lacks encryption and may be vulnerable
to attacks via Signaling System 7,
social engineering, or SIM-swapping.

## Lexicon

### Arbitrary Code

Code provided by an external source that is
executed by a system without validation or
restriction.

### Build and Release Pipeline

A series of automated processes that compile
and deploy software. Similar to the generic
term CI/CD Pipelines, but this term excludes
some pipelines, such as pre-merge status
checks.

### Change

Any alteration of the project's codebase,
CI/CD Pipelines, or documentation. This may
include addition, deletion, or modification
of content.

### CI/CD Pipeline

Automated pipelines for Continuous
Integration and Continuous Delivery.
Responsible for building, testing, and
delivering changes. These pipelines integrate
contributions frequently, enabling rapid and
reliable software delivery. CI focuses on
testing and building code, while CD delivers
software to location such as a package
registry.

In the context of the Open Source Project
Security Baseline, CD refers only to
continuous delivery, not to continuous
deployment, as sometimes used elsewhere.

### Contributor

Entities who commit code or documentation to
the project. Code contributors include
collaborators or external participants who
submit changes.

In the context of the Open Source Project
Security Baseline, code contributors does not
address non-code contributions such as
designing, triaging, reviewing, or testing.

### Codebase

The collection of source code and related
assets that make up the project. The codebase
includes all files necessary to build and
test the software. Lives in the repository,
sometimes alongside documentation and CI/CD
pipelines. The contents of the codebase are
the primary deliverable in a release.

### Collaborator

A user with access to the project's version
control system who can commit to the
codebase, approve changes, or manage the
repository settings. Collaborators may have
varying permission levels based on their role
in the project.

### Commit

A record of a single change submitted to the
version control system. Each commit includes
details such as the modifications made, the
contributor who made them, and the timestamp
of the change.

### Defect

Errors or flaws in the software that cause it
to produce incorrect or unintended results, 
or to behave in an unintended way. Defects
can include bugs, vulnerabilities, or other
issues that impact the software's
functionality or security. Defects may have
originally been intentional, but a change in
environment or understanding has made them
undesirable.

### Exploitable Vulnerabilities

Defects in the software that can be leveraged
by attackers to gain unauthorized access,
execute arbitrary code, or cause other
undesired outcomes.

### License

A legal document that defines the terms under
which the software can be used, modified, and
distributed. May be stored at the top level
of the repository in a file named `LICENSE`
or within files in a directory named
`LICENSE/`. The license applies to repository
contents and any released software assets,
unless otherwise stated.

### Known Vulnerabilities

Publicly acknowledged exploitable
vulnerabilities that have been identified
within the software. These vulnerabilities
often have associated advisories, patches, or
recommended mitigations.

### Multi-factor Authentication

An authentication method that requires two or
more verification factors (e.g., a password
and a token) to gain access to a resource.
This method strengthens security by requiring
multiple forms of identification.

### Primary Branch

The main development branch in the version
control system, representing the latest
stable codebase. Releases are typically made
from this branch. Commonly named `main` or
`master`. In some situations where branches
are not featured, a repository with forked
repositories will have the original repo
acting as an equivalent to the primary
branch.

### Project Documentation

Written materials related to the project,
such as user guides, developer guides, and
contribution guidelines. These documents help
users and developers understand, contribute
to, and interact with the software. At
release time, this may include provenance
information, licensing details, and other
metadata.

### Software Provenance

Information about the origin and history of
the released software assets. This may
include details about its development,
dependencies, vulnerabilities, contributors,
and licensing.

### Release

- _(verb)_ The process of making a version
controlled bundle of assets available to
users, such as through a package registry.
- _(noun)_ A version-controlled bundle of
code, documentation, and other assets made
available to users. A release often includes
release notes that describe the changes.

### Released Software Asset

Deliverables provided to users as part of a
release. These assets can include binaries,
libraries, or containers.

### Repository

A storage location managed by a version
control system where the project's code,
documentation, and other resources are
stored. It tracks changes, manages
collaborator permissions, and includes
configuration options such as branch
protection and access controls.

### Software Composition Analysis

The process of identifying and cataloging all
components and dependencies in a software
codebase. SCA is essential for managing
security vulnerabilities and ensuring
compliance with organizational policies.

### Status Check

Automated tests or validations that run on
commits before they are merged. Status checks
ensure that any changes meet the project's
quality and security standards.

### Subproject

A codebase that is part of the project but
maintained in a separate repository.
Subprojects may be compiled into the primary
project or used as standalone components.

### Version Identifier

A label assigned to a specific release of the
software, such as `v1.2.3`. Commonly
recommended formats are Semantic Versioning
or Calendar Versioning.

### Version Control System

A tool that tracks changes to files over time
and facilitates collaboration among
contributors. Examples of version control
systems include Git, Subversion, and
Mercurial.

### Vulnerability Reporting

The act of identifying and documenting
exploitable vulnerabilities in released
software assets. This may include privately
or openly reporting vulnerabilities to
maintainers, security teams, or the public,
as well as tracking the resolution of these
vulnerabilities.

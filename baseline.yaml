      subprojects produced by the project are held
      to a standard that clear and appropriate
      for that codebase.
    implementation: |
      The parent project should maintain a list of
      any codebases that are considered
      subprojects or additional repositories.
      Collaborators on those repositories should
      identify the proper maturity level and apply
      the Open Source Project Security Baseline to
      the codebase. Any subproject or repository
      which is compiled into the primary project
      must be held to the same standard as the
      primary project. Others may be held to a
      lower standard if they have lower levels of
      adoption or are not intended for general
      use.

    criteria: |
      The version control system MUST NOT contain
      generated executable artifacts.
    objective: |
      Reduce the risk of including generated
      executable artifacts in the project's
      version control system, ensuring that only
      source code and necessary files are stored
      in the repository.
    implementation: |
      Remove generated executable artifacts
      in the project's version control system.

      It is recommended that any scenario where
      a binary artifact appears critical to a
      process such as testing, it should be stored
      in a separate repository and fetched during
      a specific well-documented pipeline step.

    category: Access Control
    criteria: |
      The project's version control system MUST
      require multi-factor authentication that
      does not include SMS for users when
      modifying the project repository settings or
      accessing sensitive data.
    objective: |
      Ensure that multi-factor authentication
      does not allow SMS as a factor, because
      SMS lacks encryption and may be vulnerable
      to attacks via Signaling System 7,
      social engineering, or SIM-swapping.
    implementation: | # NOTE: I don't think this is currently possible in GitHub
      Require multi-factor authentication methods
      that do not include SMS for users. Common
      alternatives include hardware tokens, mobile
      authenticator apps, or biometric
      authentication.

    criteria: |
      The project documentation MUST include a
      policy to address applicable Software
      Composition Analysis results prior to any
      release.
    objective: |
      Ensure that potential vulnerabilities or
      licensing issues identified by SCA tools
      are addressed before software releases,
      reducing the risk of shipping insecure or
      non-compliant software.
    implementation: |
      Document a policy in the project to address
      applicable Software Composition Analysis 
      results before any release, and add status
      checks that verify compliance with that 
      policy prior to release.

      are either fixed or verified as
      unexploitable.
    objective: |
      Establish a process for evaluating and
      addressing known vulnerabilities, then
      communicate this process to users and
      contributors alike.
    implementation: |
      Define a policy in the project
      documentation for evaluating known
      vulnerabilities, fixing exploitable
      vulnerabilities, and verifying unexploitable
      vulnerabilities.

lexicon:
  - term: Arbitrary Code
    definition: |
      Code provided by an external source that is
      executed by a system without validation or
      restriction.
  - term: Build and Release Pipeline
    definition: |
      A series of automated processes that compile
      and deploy software. Similar to the generic
      term CI/CD Pipelines, but this term excludes
      some pipelines, such as pre-merge status
      checks.
  - term: Change
    definition: |
      Any alteration of the project's codebase,
      CI/CD Pipelines, or documentation. This may
      include addition, deletion, or modification
      of content.
  - term: CI/CD Pipeline
    definition: |
      Automated pipelines for Continuous
      Integration and Continuous Delivery.
      Responsible for building, testing, and
      delivering changes. These pipelines integrate
      contributions frequently, enabling rapid and
      reliable software delivery. CI focuses on
      testing and building code, while CD delivers
      software to location such as a package
      registry.

      In the context of the Open Source Project
      Security Baseline, CD refers only to
      continuous delivery, not to continuous
      deployment, as sometimes used elsewhere.
  - term: Contributor
    definition: |
      Entities who commit code or documentation to
      the project. Code contributors include
      collaborators or external participants who
      submit changes.

      In the context of the Open Source Project
      Security Baseline, code contributors does not
      address non-code contributions such as
      designing, triaging, reviewing, or testing.
  - term: Codebase
    definition: |
      The collection of source code and related
      assets that make up the project. The codebase
      includes all files necessary to build and
      test the software. Lives in the repository,
      sometimes alongside documentation and CI/CD
      pipelines. The contents of the codebase are
      the primary deliverable in a release.
  - term: Collaborator
    definition: |
      A user with a role on the project's version
      control system who can approve changes or
      manage the repository settings. Collaborators
      may have varying permission levels based on
      their role in the project. This does not
      include contributors whose changes only
      originate through a request from a repository
      fork.
  - term: Commit
    definition: |
      A record of a single change submitted to the
      version control system. Each commit includes
      details such as the modifications made, the
      contributor who made them, and the timestamp
      of the change.
  - term: Defect
    definition: |
      Errors or flaws in the software that cause it
      to produce incorrect or unintended results, 
      or to behave in an unintended way. Defects
      can include bugs, vulnerabilities, or other
      issues that impact the software's
      functionality or security. Defects may have
      originally been intentional, but a change in
      environment or understanding has made them
      undesirable.
  - term: Exploitable Vulnerabilities

      - MFA
  - term: Primary Branch
    definition: |
      The main development branch in the version
      control system, representing the latest
      stable codebase. Releases are typically made
      from this branch. Commonly named `main` or
